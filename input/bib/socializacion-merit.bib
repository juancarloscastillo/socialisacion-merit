  abstract = {In this review, I provide an overview of the literature investigating the social psychology of economic inequality, focusing on individuals’ understandings, perceptions, and reactions to inequality. I begin by describing different ways of measuring perceptions of inequality, and conclude that absolute measures—which ask respondents to estimate inequality in more concrete terms—tend to be more useful and accurate than relative measures. I then describe how people understand inequality, highlighting the roles of cognitive heuristics, accessibility of information, self-interest, and context and culture. I review the evidence regarding how people react to inequality, suggesting that inequality is associated with higher well-being in developing nations but lower well-being in developed nations, mostly because of hopes or fears for the future. The evidence from developed nations suggests that inequality increases individuals’ concerns about status and economic resources, increases their perception that the social world is competitive and individualistic, and erodes their faith in others, political systems, and democracy in general.}

  abstract = {This article discusses the relationship between socialization and inequality, exploring the case of the working class in Portugal. Bringing together different sociologic traditions, the framework draws upon Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and practices, balanced with recent research on life histories, globalization and individualization. The life stories of 52 workers produced in the context of an adult education programme are analysed, focusing on two major topics: life pathways and class trajectories, and subjectivity, identity and values (stressing the weak class consciousness). The article discusses the potentialities/challenges of using the biographical method to study socialization and inequalities, particularly when developed in educational contexts. According to the analysis, life pathways are often branded by temporary rural, industrial and services work experiences, crossed by turning points' and dramatic moments, though with some generational and gender differences. Classes are seldom referred to, but narratives are framed by key socialization institutions (work, family, local community, church, army) and a sense of deficit, pride and shame, linked to the inequalities structure. Although a pervasive economic, cultural and political change from the 1960s on is evident, our research found key features of a working-class habitus, rooted in specific life paths and socialization institutions. These are likely to be stretched in the current context of economic crisis and neoliberal policies in southern Europe.},

  abstract = {Resumen Este artículo discute la importancia y centralidad que ha adquirido el mérito en la sociedad chilena hoy, enfocándose principalmente en sus efectos asociados con la experiencia educacional. El argumento es desarrollado en tres pasos. Luego de una presentación del contexto histórico y de las transformaciones sociales que dan cuenta de su expansión, se analizan sobre todo las maneras en que el reconocimiento del mérito es distintamente evaluado en las diferentes etapas de la trayectoria escolar por las clases medias y los sectores populares. En un tercer momento, se muestra de qué manera a través del extendido recurso a las redes sociales y a los contactos interpersonales, la expansión del mérito se acompaña del surgimiento de un nuevo horizonte de injusticia social. El artículo pone en evidencia, así, a la vez el fuerte consenso en torno al valor del mérito en Chile y los sentimientos de injusticia y frustración que ello engendra en los individuos. La discusión presentada se basa en los resultados de dos estudios cualitativos. La primera investigación se desarrolló en las ciudades de Santiago, Concepción y Valparaíso, entre 2007 y 2009, a través de alrededor de un centenar de entrevistas a hombres y mujeres de entre 30 y 55 años, pertenecientes la mitad de ellos a sectores populares urbanos y la otra mitad a las clases medias y medias-altas. La segunda investigación, en curso, aportó al análisis dieciséis entrevistas hechas en Santiago, a lo largo del 2014, a partir de las cuales se profundizó la problemática del mérito.            ,               Abstract This article discusses the importance and centrality that merit has in Chilean society today, focusing on its multidirectional relationships to the educational realm. Our argument will be developed in three steps. Firstly, we will present the historical context of the social transformations that are to be related with the expansion of the principle of merit in this society. Secondly, we will analyze the manners in which the recognition of merit is evaluated at each of the different stages of school trajectories by members of middle and popular sectors. Finally, we will describe and discuss the way in which, due to the maintained impact of social networks and interpersonal contacts, the expansion of merit is closely related to the emergence of a new horizon of social injustice. Consequently, the article evidences that, concerning the expansion of the principle of merit in Chile, we face a twofold process: the emergence of a strong consensus about the value of merit, and the widespread sentiments of injustice and frustration that it produces in individuals. This discussion is based upon the findings of two qualitative studies. The first one was developed between 2007 and 2009 in Santiago, Concepción and Valparaíso cities, in Chile. About one hundred interviews were held with men and women aged 30 to 55 years of middle and popular sectors. The second, an ongoing study, provided our analysis with sixteen interviews, which were carried out in Santiago in 2014, and enabled us to further analyze the merit theme.}

This study examines the influence of parents, peer groups, teachers and the schools on student values as assessed by the Schwartz Value Survey. A sample of students at Grade 12 was chosen from 11 South Australian secondary schools of a wide variety of types, and the students, their parents and their teachers completed the Value Survey, and students also provided sociodemographic information. The data were analysed using the HLM multilevel analysis program with respect to the four higher order value components, namely self-transcendence, self-enhancement, conservation and openness to change in order to identify student level and school level effects on the values held by the students. Results showed that sex of student, language background, the Christian involvement of the student, parental social position and the values held by parents and peer groups had much greater effects upon the students' values than the schools and their teachers. Further research involving a larger number of schools in a wider variety of settings is suggested to build on this exploratory study.},

Los resultados muestran que los expertos refieren al mérito y la meritocracia no solo utilizando distintas definiciones, sino también otorgándole distinta relevancia social. Asimismo, el esfuerzo adquiere mayor valoración que el talento, que inversamente aparece más desarrollado en la literatura internacional. Los resultados son discutidos considerando el contexto socio-cultural chileno, caracterizado por una rápida modernización neoliberal y una alta desigualdad económica.Palabras claves:~meritocracia; ciencias sociales; académicos; neoliberalismo; Chile}

  abstract = {Educational institutions are considered a keystone for the establishment of a meritocratic society. They supposedly serve two functions: an educational function that promotes learning for all, and a selection function that sorts individuals into different programs, and ultimately social positions, based on individual merit. We study how the function of selection relates to support for assessment practices known to harm vs. benefit lower status students, through the perceived justice principles underlying these practices. We study two assessment practices: normative assessment focused on ranking and social comparison, known to hinder the success of lower status students and formative assessment focused on learning and improvement, known to benefit lower status students. Normative assessment is usually perceived as relying on an equity principle, with rewards being allocated based on merit and should thus appear as positively associated with the function of selection. Formative assessment is usually perceived as relying on corrective justice that aims to ensure equality of outcomes by considering students' needs, which makes it less suitable for the function of selection. A questionnaire measuring these constructs was administered to university students. Results showed that believing that education is intended to select the best students positively predicts support for normative assessment, through increased perception of its reliance on equity, and negatively predicts support for formative assessment, through reduced perception of its ability to establish corrective justice. This study suggests that the belief in the function of selection as inherent to educational institutions can contribute to the reproduction of social inequalities by preventing change from assessment practices known to disadvantage lower-status student, namely normative assessment, to more favorable practices, namely formative assessment, and by promoting matching beliefs in justice principles.},

In this paper we explore whether rising segregation may in turn erode support for the redistributive policies of the welfare state, further increasing levels of inequality—a form of positive feedback. The role of the neighbourhood has been neglected in attitudes research but, building on both political geography and ‘neighbourhood effects’ literatures, we theorise that neighbourhood context may shape attitudes through the transmission of attitudes directly and through the accumulation of relevant knowledge. We test this through multilevel modelling of data from England on individual attitudes to redistribution in general and to welfare benefit recipients in particular. We show that the individual factors shaping these attitudes are quite different and that the influence of neighbourhood context also varies as a result. The findings support the idea that neighbourhood context shapes attitudes, with the knowledge accumulation mechanism likely to be the more important. Rising spatial segregation would appear to erode support for redistribution but to increase support for welfare recipients—at least in a context where the dominant media discourse presents such a stigmatising image of those on welfare benefits.},

In general, inequalities are more likely to be accepted by people of higher socioeconomic status, in richer societies and when inequalities are perceived as justifiable owing to differences in productivity. Alms et al. (2020) show that in a relatively unequal society (the United States), the highly educated accept inequality significantly more than the less educated, whereas, in a relatively equal society (Norway), the less educated accept inequality more, but not significantly more, than the highly educated. Here, we replicate this finding using data from experiments conducted in four locations across three countries all distinct from the ones studied by Alms et al. However, a closer look at the data indicates that the origin of the interaction effect varies depending on which societies one compares. Data for Norway and the United States indicate that meritocratic values among the highly educated are less prevalent in more equal societies and that this is the driver of the triple interaction effect. In contrast, in our data the interaction effects have multiple drivers.},

However, this one-dimensional model cannot easily accommodate substantive changes in the norms that influence girls’ sexualities. Contemporary scholarship generated across the Anglophone West includes many signs that such a shift has occurred, ushered in by the cultural and ideological suffusion of neoliberalism. I enlist interdisciplinary and international evidence of neoliberalism’s influence on constructions of girls’ sexuality to argue that in the U.S., girls are now judged on their adherence not only to gendered moralist norms, but also to a neoliberal script of sexual agency. In addition to reviewing conceptual and empirical grounds for this claim, I consider the multidimensional normative field created by the intersection of this Agency Line with the long-standing Virgin-Slut Continuum. The primacy of agency within neoliberal discourse seems to legitimize women’s sexual autonomy and its subjective nature may permit them some control over their position above the Agency Line. But upon critical inspection it becomes clear that young women remain confined to a prescribed normative space that divides them from one another, compels self-blame, and predicates their worth on cultural appraisals of their sexuality.},

These conditions block participation in the activities of citizenship by poor youth and their families, compared to wealthier citizens. Thus, the poor are not well represented in the discussions that affect their economic and social lives. Learning to be a good citizen is not easy in low-income families, where youth are distressed and schools are performing poorly. Reforming the nations' schools and increasing rates of participation in democracy may require addressing issues of income inequality and poverty, rather than most other current efforts.},

  abstract = {In this article, we investigate the methodological difference between perceived measures and actual measures in political socialization research on the influence of - for instance - family or other social network members on the development of one’s personal attitudes or preferences. More specifically, we analyze the process of intergenerational transmission of political preferences within the family using both perceived measures of one family member (i.e. the adolescent respondent) on the one hand and actual preferences (measured among father, mother and child separately) on the other hand to make statements on data reliability. We build on the results of the Parent-Child Socialization Study (PCSS), conducted in Belgium among 2,085 mother/father/child triads. In this survey, respondents were questioned not only about their own voting intention, but also about the perceived vote of the other family members. Results show that there is indeed an important difference between the two. First, adolescents tend to vastly overestimate the political correspondence between themselves and their parents. Second, our analyses suggest that using perceptions of vote choice would lead socialization researchers to very different or even opposite results than using the actual individual vote choices. The study shows that one should be very careful when interpreting the socializing effects of other social network members, when these other members were not surveyed or interviewed themselves.},

  abstract = {The American creed stresses political equality and political involvement, but substantial political inequality still persists from one generation to the next. Despite the importance of political inequality, not enough is known about the mechanisms that reproduce it. Political socialization research has focused on the transmission of political attitudes and culture across generations, but it has paid scant attention to how family transfers of economic resources, human capital, and social capital reproduce and perpetuate unequal patterns of political involvement and political authority. This article argues that more attention should be paid to measuring the persistence of political identity, political participation, civic engagement, and political influence networks over time and across generations. Special attention should be devoted to learning more about how the passage of family resources (economic resources, human capital, social capital, and cultural capital) from parents to children reproduces political inequality and reduces the opportunity for political mobility. Current data sources fall far short of what is needed to answer these questions, but linking the proposed American Opportunity Study with public voting records and with the American National Election Studies would provide a rich and powerful dataset for studying them.},

Our analysis is based principally on main documents associated to the discursive formation of the Support and Effective Access into Higher Education Program (PACE by its acronyms in Spanish), the main affirmative action program in that country. We argue that this program deploys a meritocratic exceptionality subjectification regime that governs inclusion and right to HE through a discursive chain that articulates notions of selectivity, excellence, quality, talent, sacrifice, responsibilization and critique against the dominant admission policy. This articulation is inscribed and mobilized in the discourses about working-class students, their families and schools, and the university. This makes possible, on the one hand, the legitimacy of the program as well as of their students as new constituencies with the right to HE, and on the other hand, the strategic foreclosure and invisibilisation of the structures of inequality that sustain the majority of working-class students and their knowledges excluded from HE.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality is usually assumed to be a threat to social cohesion and democracy. Nevertheless, this opposition of inequality and democracy is based on further assumptions such as (a) that people perceive economic inequality accurately, and (b) that, by and large they consider inequality unjust. Research into distributive issues has not found consistent support for neither of these assumptions. Quite the contrary, empirical evidence indicates that economic inequality is widely misperceived and that inequality is to some extent considered legitimate. So far most of the empirical evidence in the area of legitimacy comes from experimental studies in the developed world. The present research aims at widening the scope of legitimacy studies by focusing on Chile as a case country, one of the societies with the highest economic inequality worldwide, guided by the question to what extent is economic inequality considered legitimate in a context of high economic inequality? In addressing this question, and based on previous evidence, the article proposes a way to evaluate (a) the legitimacy of inequality at a country level via survey research, and (b) the role of inequality perception and justice ideologies in the justification of economic inequality. The data to be analyzed is the public opinion survey International Social Justice Project (ISJP), implemented in Chile in the year 2007 (n~=~890). Multivariate analysis results reveal signs of legitimacy of inequality in Chile, opening a series of issues regarding the acceptance and stability of unequal distributions.},

La presente investigación propone un marco conceptual y empírico para el estudio de las percepciones y preferencias meritocráticas que, posteriormente, es relacionado con una serie de variables relativas a la desigualdad social. Utilizando datos de la encuesta chilena “Justicia social y participación ciudadana” (N= 1.245), los resultados del análisis sugieren que las preferencias y percepciones de la meritocracia son constructos distintos y que quienes perciben un adecuado funcionamiento de la meritocracia también perciben menos desigualdad social.}

We argue that this distinction is not only conceptually cogent, but empirically important as well. Indeed, class and status do have distinct explanatory power when it comes to studying varying areas of social life. Consistent with Weber's assertions, we show that economic security and prospects are stratified more by class than by status, while the opposite is true for outcomes in the domain of cultural consumption. Within politics, class rather than status predicts Conservative versus Labour Party voting in British general elections and also Left-Right political attitudes. But it is status rather than class that predicts Libertarian-Authoritarian attitudes.},

While politicians have, since the city-state's independence, exercised 'strong' ideological leadership over Singapore's economy and society, including education - there are simultaneously aspects of 'neoliberal' logics in Singapore's education system: extensive school choice and streaming, academic competition and the self-responsibilising meritocratic ethos. Literature on the nature and effects of neoliberalism typically depicts rising inequalities and families' growing anxieties, due to competition and self-responsibilisation. Drawing on in-depth interviews, this article explores how a group of low-income Malay parents navigate two aspects of institutionalised neoliberalism: (1) responsibilisation of young people within a meritocratic regime, (2) responsibilisation of parents as stakeholders in an increasingly complex education landscape. We find that while families internalise responsibilisation - profound trust in the state remains. Empirical particularities are drawn upon to understand how a socio-politically-constituted 'architecture of trust' between state and low-income parents is built, and its implications on families' lives.},

Although perceptions of both distributive and procedural justice were negatively correlated with student aggression and hostility, hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that only perceptions of procedural justice predicted these two criterion variables. The relationships between perceptions of justice and students' use of resistance strategies were less consistent. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that perceptions of procedural justice negatively predicted student revenge and deception. Contrary to predictions, perceptions of procedural and distributive justice did not interact to predict student aggression, hostility, or resistance. In short, students' perceptions of procedural justice in the classroom—for example that grades were distributed on the basis of fair evaluation criteria—appear more important than students' beliefs about the fairness of the assigned grade in determining student compliance and civility.},

La confianza política es especialmente importante en las democracias no solo para sostener y construir la cohesión social, sino también para alentar a los ciudadanos a trabajar juntos por los principios democráticos. En este capítulo nos propusimos investigar el papel de las escuelas y la contribución que pueden hacer para generar confianza política entre los jóvenes. Además, queremos centrarnos en el uso de modelos multinivel como una técnica analítica que tiene el potencial de aprovechar los resultados en diferentes niveles de los sistemas educativos. La muestra comprendía 23,654 estudiantes de secundaria básica que habían participado recientemente en el Estudio Internacional de Educación Cívica y Ciudadanía de 2009 (ICCS2009). Los estudiantes fueron seleccionados de escuelas en cinco sociedades asiáticas, a saber, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Corea, Taiwán y Tailandia. Las escuelas se eligieron mediante muestreo probabilístico proporcional y los estudiantes de las escuelas provenían de una sola clase intacta. La edad media de los estudiantes era de 13,5 años en el momento de la prueba dentro de cada sociedad. Los resultados muestran que las escuelas pueden desempeñar un papel en el desarrollo de la confianza política en las cinco sociedades que hemos estudiado. Dentro de las sociedades, las escuelas que utilizan procesos y estructuras generalmente democráticos para los estudiantes tienen más probabilidades de generar confianza política que las que no lo hacen. Sin embargo, existe una diferencia sustancial entre sociedades en los mecanismos a través de los cuales la escuela influye en la confianza política de los estudiantes. Además, se observan matices en las sociedades en cuanto a género y roles parentales. Los hallazgos reportados en este capítulo han proporcionado información importante para futuras investigaciones sobre la socialización política de los adolescentes. © 2011 por Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The subjects graded and other situational characteristics were varied. In both studies, factor analyses consistently revealed that students’ justice judgments were contingent on the comparison standard applied, but independent of other situational characteristics. Criterion-referenced grading was rated as the most just practice, individual-referenced grading as almost just, and norm-referenced grading as almost unjust. The better the grades received the more the students evaluated criterion-referenced grading to be just. Students attending intermediate-track schools did not object to norm-referenced grading as strongly as their peers at academic-track schools did. Consequences for teachers’ grading practices are discussed.}

  abstract = {In the educational system, social inequalities are reproduced and legitimated. As a consequence, the implementation of interventions that reduce the SES achievement gap in education may face important ideological barriers. The purpose of the present article is to test the belief in school meritocracy as one of these barriers. In three studies, participants' willingness to see an equalizing pedagogical intervention implemented in one's own university (Study 1) or in one's own children's school (Studies 2 and 3) and their intention to engage in this implementation were measured. Results indicated that a higher belief in school meritocracy (but not meritocracy endorsement, Study 1) predicted lower engagement in the implementation of an equalizing method. This is not observed for inequality-maintaining interventions (Studies 2 and 3), sustaining the role of descriptive school meritocracy in the perpetuation of social inequalities within education.},

A lower socioeconomic status is related to lower intended political participation of adolescents. Within this context, schools play a crucial role in political socialisation, as citizenship education is assumed to either equalise or maintain these social disparities. We analyse a sub-dataset of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 which includes 14-year-old students in four European countries: Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia) and the Netherlands. Multi-level regression analyses reveal that formal citizenship education compensates the relationship between students' socioeconomic status and intended electoral participation in Denmark, Germany (NRW) and the Netherlands, but not in Belgium (FL). Further, the composition of school classes is related to the perception of an open classroom climate in each of the four countries and to participation in civic activities at school in three countries.},

We use survey data on gender attitudes (specifically, about the appropriate roles and rights of women and girls) collected from nearly 5500 adolescents attending 314 schools in the state of Haryana, and their parents. We find that when a parent holds a more discriminatory attitude, his or her child is about 11 percentage points more likely to hold the view. We find that parents hold greater sway over students' gender attitudes than their peers do, and that mothers influence children's gender attitudes more than fathers. Parental attitudes influence child attitudes more in Scheduled Caste communities and student gender attitudes are positively correlated with behaviours such as interacting with children of the opposite gender.},

We considered students' individual experience of teacher and classmate justice as possible mediators of these relations, and statistically controlled for student sex, internet use, empathy, and social desirability. Bootstrap mediation analyses showed that the more students endorsed personal BJW, the more they evaluated their teachers' and classmates' behavior toward them personally as just, and the less likely they were to report that they cyber-bullied others or were victims of cyber-bullying. The students' individual experiences of teacher justice mediated the association between personal BJW and cyber-bullying perpetration, whereas their experience of classmate justice mediated the relation between personal BJW and cyber-bullying victimization. The pattern of results persisted when we controlled for student sex, average internet use per day, empathy, and social desirability. We discuss the adaptive functions of BJW and implications for future school research and practice.},

I begin by describing different ways of measuring perceptions of inequality, and conclude that absolute measures—which ask respondents to estimate inequality in more concrete terms—tend to be more useful and accurate than relative measures.  I then describe how people understand inequality, highlighting the roles of cognitive heuristics, accessibility of information, self-interest, and context and culture.  I review the evidence regarding how people react to inequality, suggesting that inequality is associated with higher well-being in developing nations but lower well-being in developed nations, mostly because of hopes or fears for the future.  The evidence from developed nations suggests that inequality increases individuals’ concerns about status and economic resources, increases their perception that the social world is competitive and individualistic, and erodes their faith in others, political systems, and democracy in general.},

This longitudinal study examined the bidirectional relationships of classroom justice with students' behavioral problems, well-being, and joy of learning. Using systematic observation on the singlechild level, teachers and external observers made high and low inference justice ratings of 245 primary school students. The justice ratings measured two aspects of classroom justice: pedagogical practices and teacher–child interactions. Results indicate that there is a bidirectional relationship between behavioral problems and classroom justice. On the one hand, behavioral problems led to a decrease in the respectfulness of teacher–child interactions as rated by the teachers. On the other hand, just pedagogical practices as rated by external observers led to decreases in the children's behavioral problems but also in their joy of learning. There was a negative effect of justice sensitivity on joy of learning. These results might be due to teachers' adaptiveness. Teachers might especially focus their attention and efforts on the children who seem to need them the most, for instance, children with a low joy of learning or behavioral problems. These results might be used to sensitize teachers and school developers to the importance of classroom justice.},

Children frequently explained disparities in terms of institutions' differing financial resources, revealing awareness that economic inequalities often underlie groups' differential access to societal resources. Further, children attributed inequalities to differential treatment more often when they witnessed' African-Americans at a disadvantage than when they witnessed European Americans at a disadvantage, demonstrating awareness that racial minority groups are more likely to experience restricted access to resources. Finally, children who reasoned about differential treatment judged inequality, and actions that perpetuated inequality, more negatively than children who attributed inequalities to institutions' differing needs, revealing a link between awareness of discrimination and rejection of social inequalities.

Data are from 31 nations and 66,777 individual respondents analyzed using structural equation and multilevel regression methods with multiple imputation of missing data. Results. In poor countries, but not in rich, most believe that family needs legitimate higher pay. Within countries—particularly English-speaking ones—low SES groups endorse family needs, but high SES groups reject them. Valuing performance and effort is widespread throughout the world and throughout all segments of society, high and low. Education and authority are widely valued, more in poor nations than in rich, with some demographic differences but few socioeconomic cleavages. Conclusions. There is conflict both within nations and between them as to whether need and education/authority justify unequal pay, but consensus that performance on the job does justify it.}

In the present cross-sectional study, associations between students’ perceptions of school climate dimensions and their level of engagement were explored. The differential effects on these associations of sex and social background were also examined. Results from a sample of 955 high-school students showed that a model incorporating six dimensions of perceived school climate explained a large proportion of the variance in students’ engagement, especially affective engagement. The perceived climate of relations between teachers and students appeared to be highly predictive of students’ engagement. Analyses also revealed that the predictiveness of school climate factors for affective, cognitive and behavioral engagement varied slightly according to sex and social background.

Youth report more confidence in social authorities than in legal authorities. Furthermore, whereas confidence in social authorities remained largely stable between the cohorts over the last decade, confidence in legal authorities, and in law enforcement in particular, has declined markedly. Although there may be an era of mistrust in legal authorities, it cannot be attributed to a ubiquitous anti-authority attitude among modern adolescents in the United States.},

The results were cross-validated using a different sample of 15,940 students in primary and secondary education. We were able to distinguish four citizenship orientations among students (societal interest, prosocial ability, reflective thinking and assertiveness) and two domains of citizenship knowledge (societal knowledge and interpersonal knowledge). This framework can help with the large-scale, empirical evaluation of the effects of citizenship education and also guide schools in the formulation of educational goals to support the development of citizenship competences among students.},

In this paper we assess some of the empirical links between police legitimacy, political ideology (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and support for `reasonable' use of force (e.g. an officer striking a citizen in self-defence) and `excessive' use of force (e.g. an officer using violence to arrest an unarmed person who is not offering violent resistance). Analysing data from an online survey with US participants (n = 186) we find that legitimacy is a positive predictor of reasonable but not excessive police use of force, and that political ideology predicts support for excessive but not reasonable use of force. We conclude with the idea that legitimacy places normative constraints around police power. On the one hand, legitimacy is associated with increased support for the use of force, but only when violence is bounded within certain acceptable limits. On the other hand, excessive use of force seems to require an extra-legal justification that is – at least in our analysis – partly ideological. Our findings open up a new direction of research in what is currently a rather sparse psychological literature on the ability of legitimacy to `tame' coercive power.},

However, it is far from clear what considerations teachers have when making seating arrangements. Therefore, in this study seating arrangement considerations from 50 teachers in grades 4–6 of elementary school were assessed. In Phase 1, teachers were interviewed about their goals and considerations for classroom seating arrangements. Teachers mentioned between 2 and 19 reasons for placing students at specific places in the classroom, with mostly academic considerations. They mainly preferred arrangements in small groups to promote student cooperation. In Phase 2, teachers completed a questionnaire about seating arrangements. This allowed us to examine individual differences between teachers related to gender, years of experience, and beliefs, and the concurrence between the interview and questionnaire data. Teachers reported multiple and various considerations for seating arrangements. Correlations with their general student-oriented or subject-oriented beliefs and personal characteristics were low. The concurrence between measurement methods also was low. The discussion focused on teacher awareness of classroom seating arrangements as an important part of classroom management and a tool for prevention and intervention.},

To answer this question, we examine parent–child similarities of general values as well as specific attitudes and behaviours related to three common household practices: purchasing environmentally friendly products, curtailing electricity use, and handling waste responsibly in a sample of 601 Danish families. Significant and positive, but weak correlations between parents' and children's values are found across all of Schwartz's ten value domains. The parent–child correlations are stronger for specific pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours. The positive correlations suggest that family socialization exert a significant influence on young consumers' pro-environmental orientation. Still, the young generation is, on average, significantly less environmentally concerned than their parents' generation. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

I hypothesise that based on the psychological mechanism of self-serving bias in causal attribution, those who experience upward social mobility are more likely to support greater income differences, and that subjective intergenerational mobility has stronger association with attitudes towards income differences than objective mobility because individuals filter their objective environment in order to derive their subjective perceptions of the world and their own experiences. The described hypotheses are tested with two cross-national data sets – European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings are robust to alternative statistical specifications and indicate that individuals who perceive themselves as subjectively mobile have significantly different attitudes towards income differences in comparison to non-mobile groups, but that this effect does not manifest among objectively mobile individuals.},

Conversely, living overseas had a negative effect on respondents' support for Chinese democratization, as the longer they had lived in the United States, the better they understood Western democracy and were suspicious about whether China should pursue immediate democratization. Meanwhile, we also find Chinese media has a negative impact on public support for democracy, both instrumental and intrinsic. Finally, factors associated with attitudes toward democracy, such as traditional values, self-expression values, and perceived performance of the Chinese government, were also significant.},

  abstract = {Based on a study of 12,000 elementary schoolchildren in eight large and medium-sized American cities, this book presents the first large-scale study of political attitude formation in children. The authors view political development from the perspective of a general theory of socialization, and compare the influences of social class, intelligence, teacher attitude, and religious membershipon the growth of political attitudes. The book outlines the way in which the child\&\#39;s political awareness evolvesfrom identification with authority figures such as father, policeman, the president, to a grasp of more abstract political concepts and the rudiments of political participation. Illuminating a topic of great theoretical concern and practical educational importance, the book is a significant contribution to the fields of political sociology, child development and educational psychology, and an important reference work for all concerned with the processes of socialization and of attitude formation in general. The Development of Political Attitudes in Children was based on a major survey, the first of its kind, begun at the University of Chicago in 1960 to ascertain information about the induction of children into the political life of the United States, to describe the nature of socialization into citizenship roles, and to examine pre-adult political learning and behavior in terms of other implications for the stability of the political system. Professor Frederick Frey of MIT described it as \&quot;an indispensable work for all who are trying to develop this new and tremendously important vineyardas nearly indispensable as any book of the past several years.\&quot; \&quot;Their verbatim interviews with grade-schoolers are pungent and entertaining.

While the Singapore education system is not unique in its stratification of students into distinct educational tracks with diverse educational outcomes, it is one of the very few countries with explicitly differentiated formal national citizenship curricula for students from different educational tracks. Students are formally allocated different citizenship roles and responsibilities according to the hierarchy defined by the state. Three distinct roles can be identified: (1) elite cosmopolitan leaders; (2) globally-oriented but locally-rooted mid-level executives and workers; and (3) local 'heartlander' followers. To cater to these different citizen roles, the three programmes encompass significantly different curricular goals, content, modes of assessment, civic skills, and values. The findings indicate that only the elite students have access to citizenship education that promotes democratic enlightenment and political engagement. The social studies curriculum for students in the vocational track, in contrast, focuses almost exclusively on imparting a pre-determined body of knowledge and set of values deemed necessary for academically low-achieving students.},

While some authors assume a direct socialisation effect of educational experience, others have argued that education should be seen as a mere proxy variable for socio-economic status and pre-adult socialisation experiences. In this article we use a 5-year Belgian panel study that tracked respondents between the ages of 16 and 21. Using a hierarchical linear model of repeated measurements, we are able to demonstrate that differences with regard to political trust between future students and non-students are already present and stable at the age of sixteen. Significant determinants were school track and educational goal. The inclusion of actual educational status in the model (at age 21), however, rendered the relation with educational goal not significant. The results suggest that during secondary education students already anticipate and acquire a value pattern that is congruent with their future status. Ultimately, however, this effect is dependent on whether they actually enrol in higher education or not.},

  abstract = {Despite convergence processes between Western and post-socialist societies in the past three decades, there are still considerable cross-country differences in individuals\&rsquo; attitudes toward income inequality. To explain these differences, studies have primarily focused on the role of macro level differences and have only theoretically acknowledged how the role of diverging socialization experiences could also be responsible. To date, little is known about the importance of socialization for attitudes toward income inequality.

To explain these differences, studies have primarily focused on the role of macro level differences and have only theoretically acknowledged how the role of diverging socialization experiences could also be responsible.

It also provides a behavioral framework for interpreting parental investments in cultural capital.

  abstract = {This study reviews international comparative studies investigating people's views on inequality. These studies are classified using a framework consisting of three types of conceptions of inequality and two dimensions of inequality. Four perspectives are discussed explaining cross-national differences in views on inequality: the modernist, the culturalist, the micro and the macro perspective. The findings of studies comparing views on inequalities in post-communist and Western states provide more support for the modernist than for the culturalist perspective. Few comparative studies appear to investigate views on inequalities as independent variables impacting on other social attitudes and behaviours. It is argued that the social relevance of the field will be enhanced if more studies can show that views on inequality have an effect on social outcomes complementary to that of objective inequalities., L'étude fait le tour des comparaisons internationales qui ont analysé les opinions sur l'inégalité. On peut les classer à partir de trois conceptions de l'inégalité et de deux dimensions. On obtient en fait quatre modèles qui rendent compte des différences entre nations : le moderniste, le culturaliste, la perspective micro et la perspective macro. Les données comparatives pour les pays ex-communistes et les pays occidentaux s'accordent mieux avec une perspective moderniste que culturaliste. Les études comparatives ont fort peu traité les jugements sur l'inégalité comme variables indépendantes ayant un impact sur d'autres attitudes et comportements sociaux. La pertinence sociale de ce champ d'études serait augmentée si davantage d'études montraient que les jugements sur l'inégalité ont des effets sociaux qui s'ajoutent à ceux des inégalités objectives., Dieser Beitrag interessiert sich für internationale vergleichende Studien, die die Anschauungen über Ungleichheit zum Thema haben. Diese Studien lassen sich in drei Konzepte und zwei Dimensionen von Ungleichheit einteilen. Daraus entstehen vier Modelle, die die unterschiedlichen nationalen Betrachtungsweisen von Ungleichheit erklären: die modernistische Perspektive, die kulturelle Perspektive, die Mikroperspektive und die Makroperspektive. Die vergleichenden Angaben ehemaliger kommunistischer und westlicher Länder stimmen eher mit der modernistischen als mit der kulturalistischen Perspektive überein. Nur wenige der vergleichenden Studien scheinen Ungleichheiten als unabhängige Variablen zu verstehen, die zu anderen sozialen Formen und Verhaltensweisen führen könnten. Die soziale Bedeutung dieses Studienbereichs könnte zunehmen, falls mehrere Untersuchungen zeigen würden, dass die Einstufungen der Ungleichheit soziale Auswirkungen haben, die zu den objektiven Ungleichheiten hinzugefügt werden müssen.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new theory of distributive justice, one that is fully mathematized and fully testable. The theory describes how choices made by individuals (about which goods to value, which social aggregates to form, and what conditions to regard as just or fair for themselves) combine with two objective structural features--the actual distributions of goods and their intercorrelations--to produce the sentiment of justice in the individual. The theory views social relations as a meeting of justice sentiments. Hence, a social aggregate is characterized by the distribution of justice sentiments experienced by its members; and the social aggregate's characteristic social facts are approximated by the parameters of the distribution of justice sentiments, such parameters as the proportion who feel unjustly underrewarded, the Gini's mean difference, the lower extreme value, the overall mean, and many others. By holding constant both the goods of value to the members of a social aggregate and the condition regarded by them as just or fair, it becomes possible to generate expected distributions of justice sentiments from knowledge of the actual distributions of goods, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the theory. In this paper, using three hypothetical distributions of goods (Rectangular, Pareto, and Lognormal), we generate the corresponding expected justice distributions--one negatively skewed Exponential, a family of positively skewed Exponentials, and a family of Normals--and evaluate many parameters of interest.}

Findings about parental influence based on youth coming of age in the 1990s strongly parallel those based on youth socialized in the 1960s. As expected on the basis of social learning theory, children are more likely to adopt their parents’ political orientations if the family is highly politicized and if the parents provide consistent cues over time. The direct transmission model is robust, as it withstands an extensive set of controls. Early acquisition of parental characteristics influences the subsequent nature of adult political development.}

  abstract = {Among a child's skills and competencies, conscientiousness has been shown to be one of the most important predictors of school performance and later academic achievement. We refer this insight to the social reproduction of social inequality: Is socialization of personality characteristics in the parental home a significant mechanism that contributes to a child's life chances? Using school grades as the outcome measure, we combine different pathways toward their achievement: the impact of a child's conscientiousness on school grades, parental conscientiousness and parental stratification as sources for the differential conscientiousness of children, and the mediation of this interrelationship through different parenting styles. To date, almost no research has been conducted which integrates the unequal formation of personality and its consequences regarding life chances and compares it with the respective influences of social origin. Moreover, we add to existing research in social reproduction the distinction between different facets of conscientiousness. We show that it allows for more precise predictions of academic achievement than looking at the highly aggregated Big Five personality traits; moreover, these facets can be much better linked to the established body of sociological stratification theory. We combine data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and the related Familien in Deutschland (FiD) study involving children 9-10 years of age and their parents and households. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we found theoretical and empirical evidence that only the "focus" facet and not the "orderliness" facet is highly positively correlated with school grades even more than indicators of social background. Our main hypothesis that conscientiousness, specifically the facet focus, acts as one "transmission belt" between social background and school grades was confirmed.

Many individuals express dissatisfaction with the high level of stratification in our society, but at the same time, they hold out the possibility that they themselves will one day rise to the top. Previous research has often focused on cultural explanations for American tolerance of inequality. While there is much support for this characterization of Americans' attitudes towards inequality as being rooted in a deep cultural ambivalence, we hypothesize that tolerance is also affected by structural conditions. Attitudes towards inequality are affected by local reference groups, and thus, individuals do not experience the full extent of inequality in society in their daily lives. Using the General Social Survey data, we investigate attitudes towards inequality within and between counties. We find that individuals' attitudes towards inequality are strongly affected by their relative, county-mean centered income, and that the relationship between relative income and tolerance for inequality is stronger in high-income counties. We infer that high levels of socio-economic segregation in the U.S. increase tolerance for inequality.},

This study finds that controlling for school fixed effects, family income, and observed characteristics of students and their families, students with higher RD within schools exhibit more depressive symptoms. This study also considers how RD may influence adolescent depression. Sobel-Goodman mediation tests reveal that a combination of lowered self-esteem and future expectations (especially about educational attainment) explains nearly half of the association between RD and adolescent depression. Results of this study suggest that social inequality and stratification may implicate population health in the next generation through socioeconomic stratification within schools.},

His analysis leads him to the thesis that, in view of the shortage in family resources, a combination of factors was required: in addition to economic and school-structural preconditions there had to be the family's support, the offers provided by the school-also in the extracurricular field-as well as the youth movement, which, in combination with the school, provided a space for socialization and for the adoption of a habitus characteristic of the educated classes.},

Retrospective information of 3.106 respondents from the Family Survey of the Dutch population are used to address questions on trends in the impact of traditional measures of parental cultural capital and the impact of parental media involvement activities. Foremost, our study highlights that the relevance of traditional parental cultural capital for children's educational success in the Netherlands diminishes over time, while parental media involvement activities became more important. Over the past decades, especially parental reading instruction and parents' setting television restriction rules became increasingly more meaningful for children's educational performance.

Specifically, the study explores the direct and indirect effects of informational and social motivations underlying localized social media uses on trust-building (interpersonal trust, political trust, and trust in community organizations) and civic participation in online and offline contexts. The findings through a nationwide survey of U.S. adults indicate that localized social media use resulted in the increase of interpersonal trust. Furthermore, the results show that trust in community organizations and local political trust played a more important role as a mediator between localized social media use and civic participation. Notably, localized social media use driven by social motivations had a greater effect on trust and civic participation than informational motivation. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed for civic technology and community building.},

This association is typically taken as prima facie evidence of economic self-interest: Classes hold different attitudes, values, and party preferences because they have different economic interests. However, this assumption has rarely been tested empirically. In this article, we use survey data from 18 West European countries to examine why classes differ on a central aspect of political preferences, namely their views on the desirability of income inequality. We find that only a moderate proportion of differences between employee classes in support for redistribution can be accounted for by contemporary differences in resources and risks; differences in economic interests to some degree account for the anti-redistributive preferences of the professional middle classes compared with the working class. However, the preferences of the self-employed have a different explanation; autonomy is a better explanation of the right-wing preferences of the self-employed compared with the working class.},

I find that middle-class young adults had more knowledge than their working-class or poor counterparts of the “rules of the game” regarding how institutions worked. They also displayed more of a sense of entitlement to ask for help. When faced with a problem related to an institution, middle-class young adults frequently succeeded in getting their needs accommodated by the institution; working-class and poor young adults were less knowledgeable about and more frustrated by bureaucracies. This address also shows the crucial role of “cultural guides” who help upwardly mobile adults navigate institutions. While many studies of class reproduction have looked at key turning points, this address argues that “small moments” may be critical in setting the direction of life paths.},

It was found that higher self-image disparity, more positive ideal self-image, and less positive real self-image were related to a higher level of moral judgment. Parental practices that emphasized unilateral respect or that were nonnurturant were related to a lower level of moral judgment and to less emphasis on postconventional judgments. Among boys, higher self-image disparity was related to authoritarian child-rearing practices. Among girls, a more positive ideal self-image was related to father's emphasis on control and supervision and the mother's emphasis on control of sex and aggression. Findings are discussed in terms of sex-role stereotyping, cognitive-developmental factors of self-image, and the importance of opportunities for autonomous functioning in the elaboration of moral judgment.

I then argue that critical studies of meritocracy need to go beyond an understanding of the term as an inherently unstable concept instantiated problematically in policy and practice. Rather, as I develop the argument further, the dynamics of meritocracy needs to be appreciated as an ideology that is negotiated by dominant social groups as these seek to legitimize particular distributions of social resources. Such dominant ideologies, however, are not only produced in the education system; they are also reproduced through it, often in far more complex ways. To see how these ideologies and their tensions animate the very mechanism that sits at the centre of the reproduction of (in) equality, viz. the curriculum, the rest of the article provides an account of how one particular subject area is differently taught in an elite and a mainstream school.},

Focusing on classroom pedagogic practices in Singapore, this article explores the ways in which in an ostensibly meritocratic education system, teachers interpret and negotiate ideas about culture to engage their students in the system's low-progress tracks. We argue that these teachers are creatively resisting, even challenging official discourses of meritocracy and engaging in what Nancy Fraser calls struggles over recognition and redistribution.},

The perspectives of researchers co-operating with educators and students against a backdrop of provincial government curricula and secondary literature on youth citizenship engagement provide an enriched understanding of the state and potential of civic learning. It concludes that current civic learning is primarily characterized by procedural knowledge and compliant codes of behaviour that do not envelope students in collective action for systemic understandings of political issues. This study argues for renewed efforts to put social justice at the heart of student learning. To present a convincing civic educational programme, schools should prepare students to analyse power relationships, investigate the ambiguities of political issues, and embrace opportunities for social change.},

It includes studies on social inequalities in 5 European and 5 Latin American countries, along 11 thematic axes: inequalities in the labour market and labour trajectories; asymmetries in the relationship between training and employment; inequalities in work and family life; educational inequalities; geographical and social inequalities: ethnicity and language; social inequalities, migration and space; uncertainty, strategies, resources and capabilities; inequality of opportunity: intergenerational social mobility; social policies; gender inequalities; and research methodology. This volume is the result of a large collaborative project on social inequality funded by the European Commission: the International Network for Comparative Analysis of Social Inequalities. Taking into account diverse perspectives and approximations, the collaborators have created a general analytical framework as a model of analysis of social inequalities. The various contributions in this volume help readers gain a global outlook and help reflect on social inequalities in a comparative perspective. This volume addresses social science graduate and postgraduate students, researchers, social policy makers, as well as a broader academic audience interested in social inequality.},

This paper investigates the social roots of that tendency by focusing on the long-term effects of childhood family background on midlife social autonomy. The effects of two aspects of family background are investigated-socioeconomic background and childhood household composition. Family background variables in these categories have small yet theoretically and statistically significant effects on midlife social autonomy. Parental education and occupation are associated with midlife social autonomy among both men and women. Early-life household composition variables and parental income are associated with social autonomy only among women. Adult status variables generally do not mediate the effects of of the family background variables on midlife social autonomy. This suggests that the long-term effects of family background on social autonomy are primarily due to early life socialization. Gender-specific socialization processes are discussed as explanations for these effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background Notwithstanding the emphasis on the idea that students should be actively and accountably engaged in their educational pathways, little research has investigated learners’ agentic behaviours that take the form of student resistance to adult authority. Aims This paper presents an experimental study aimed to assess whether, and to what extent, student Self and Other resistant agency depends on perceptions of teacher justice and student achievement. Methods Participants were asked to read one of four scenarios concerning a generic student asking for the possibility to retake a test she/he had previously failed, with an experimental design including two levels of teacher justice × 2 levels of academic achievement. Then, they answered two items regarding the likelihood of protest on the part of the student depicted in the scenario and enforced by themselves in having to deal with a similar situation. Results The multilevel analysis indicated a principal effect of justice and target, with resistant agency rated as more likely in the unjust condition and for the Other. The justice effect was further qualified by an interaction with the achievement level, with resistant agency higher in the unjust and low achievement condition. Finally, a three-way interaction appeared, with Self resistant agency higher in the just and high achievement condition. Conclusions These results are discussed in terms of their implications for teacher practices, as they emphasize the importance just learning environments have in allowing students to express their opinions as well as dissent.},

  abstract = {Schools are expected to contribute to preparing students for engaged citizenship. Research shows that open classroom discussions on political issues have a positive effect on political attitudes and behaviour. However, a deeper understanding of why students perceive their classrooms as open for discussion is missing. The purpose of this study is to examine how deliberative democratic theory can be used to explain such perceptions. We argue that the openness of the discussion climate is positively affected by, on the one hand, a context of good student–teacher relations characterised by fairness and respect, and, on the other hand, by the level of collective efficacy, which is the perception of responsiveness of the school towards student demands. Using multilevel analyses on the European data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009), we find that these predictors are significant at the student level and the school level. This means that both the individual experience of a student as well as the average school’s score on good student–teacher relations and collective efficacy affect how students perceive the discussion climate. Our findings, based on high-quality survey data from 22 countries, are a significant contribution to clarifying the underlying mechanism leading to an open classroom climate. As such discussions have proven to be an effective way to stimulate political engagement, we conclude that a school context characterised by fairness and responsiveness, should not be overlooked by schools and policy.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Because the legitimacy of political authorities exists only in the eyes of citizens, this study investigates which criteria citizens use to decide that an authority is legitimate. By comparing ideas about what makes political authorities legitimate, this study in five European democracies and hybrid regimes illuminates the ‘demand side of political legitimacy’. Using original student survey data, this article compares expectations of students from the Netherlands, France, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia about how political authorities should acquire the right to rule and how they ought to behave when in office. The analysis shows that the respondents across the five countries use similar criteria for granting legitimacy. Across the five countries, throughput and input were more important criteria for legitimacy than the output produced by authorities. Although several country differences were found, these differences did not align with regime type. The findings challenge the widespread view that what kind of authorities people consider legitimate is determined by their socialization in a particular political regimen.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality has been on the rise in the United States since the 1980s and by some measures stands at levels not seen since before the Great Depression. Although the strikingly high and rising level of economic inequality in the nation has alarmed scholars, pundits, and elected officials alike, research across the social sciences repeatedly concludes that Americans are largely unconcerned about it. Considerable research has documented, for instance, the important role of psychological processes, such as system justification and American Dream ideology, in engendering Americans’ relative insensitivity to economic inequality. The present work offers, and reports experimental tests of, a different perspective—the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality. Specifically, two convenience samples (study 1, n = 480; and study 2, n = 1,305) and one representative sample (study 3, n = 1,501) of American adults were exposed to information about rising economic inequality in the United States (or control information) and then asked about their beliefs regarding the roles of structural (e.g., being born wealthy) and individual (e.g., hard work) factors in getting ahead in society (i.e., opportunity beliefs). They then responded to policy questions regarding the roles of business and government actors in reducing economic inequality. Rather than revealing insensitivity to rising inequality, the results suggest that rising economic inequality in contemporary society can spark skepticism about the existence of economic opportunity in society that, in turn, may motivate support for policies designed to redress economic inequality.},

  abstract = {Most people misperceive economic inequality. Learning about actual levels of inequality and social mobility, research suggests, heightens concerns but may push people’s policy preferences in any number of directions. This mixed empirical record, we argue, reflects the omission of a more fundamental question: under what conditions do people change their understanding of the meritocratic or non-meritocratic causes of inequality? To explore mechanisms of belief change we field a unique randomized survey experiment with representative populations in Australia, Indonesia, and Mexico—societies with varying levels of and popular beliefs about economic inequality. Our results highlight the importance of information, perceived social position, and self-interest. In Indonesia, information describing (high) income inequality and (low) social mobility rocked our participants’ belief in meritocracy. The same information made less of a splash in Mexico, where unequal outcomes are commonly understood as the result of corruption and other non-meritocratic processes. In Australia, the impact of our information treatment was strongest when it provided justification for people’s income position or when it corrected their perception of relative affluence. Our findings reveal asymmetric beliefs about poverty and wealth and heterogeneous responses to information. They are a call to rethink effective informational and policy interventions.}

They were asked what advice they would give to their children to instill desirable values and traits in them. Aggregated to the national level, the responses yield two main dimensions of national culture. The first (collectivism-individualism) captures differences approximately along the South-North geographic axis of the Earth and is strongly correlated with differences in economic and gender inequality. The second (monumentalism-flexibility) captures cultural differences approximately on the West-East geographic axis of the world and is strongly associated with national differences in educational achievement. Thus, some of the most important national differences worldwide are strongly related to cultural differences in parental ideologies for the socialization of their children, suggesting that culture has objective societal outcomes.},

  abstract = {En las últimas décadas se ha observado una serie de amenazas a la democracia y su legitimidad. Por un lado, la persistente desigualdad en el acceso a las formas de voz política y su vínculo estrecho con las condiciones socioeconómicas, mientras por otro, una serie de indicios que muestran una creciente desafección política, particularmente de poblaciones juveniles. La preocupación por el futuro de la democracia ha volcado la mirada hacia las diversas fuentes de socialización política y la formación de los futuros ciudadanos. Esta tesis doctoral trata acerca de la siguiente pregunta de investigación: ¿En qué medida las desigualdades en las fuentes de socialización se relacionan con las diferentes expresiones de ciudadanía en los jóvenes? Específicamente, ¿en qué medida las características socioeconómicas de la familia se traducen en actitudes y participación ciudadana de la siguiente generación? Aborda, por un lado, la pregunta acerca de ¿cuáles son las principales dimensiones de un concepto amplio de ciudadanía juvenil?, y por otro, en la comprensión sobre ¿qué mecanismospermiten explicar el proceso de transmisión intergeneracional de la desigualdad política? Se organiza principalmente en torno una introducción general y cuatro artículos que abordan las preguntas de investigación formuladas. Para abordar dichas preguntas se hizo uso del Estudio Internacional de Educación Cívica y Ciudadana el año 2009 (International Civic and Citizenship Study- ICCS 2009), que consideran estudiantes de 15 años provenientes de un set de 38 países. Los datos provistos por ICCS representan una oportunidad única para el estudio de fuentes de socialización políticas en diversos contextos y el abordaje de estas preguntas de investigación. Los resultados de esta tesis corroboran que la participación ciudadana juvenil puede ser entendida y medida como un concepto amplio que contiene diversos tipos de comportamiento organizados en tres dimensiones: participación formal, participación activista y participación comunitaria. Así mismo se cofirma que las actitudes hacia la igualdad de derechos puede ser medida como una composición de las opiniones referidas a la igualdad de derechos de diversos grupos sociales históricamente excluidos. Respecto de la transmisión intergeneracional de la desigualdad política se observa que los recursos socioeconómicos ejercen una importante influencia en los diferentes tipos de participación y en las actitudes hacia la igualdad de derechos, siendo la educación lograda por lo padres y los libros disponibles en el hogar las formas de estratificación más relevantes para explicar el comportamiento y las actitudes ciudadanas. La educación lograda por los padres y las consecuencias que ello implica para sus propias disposiciones democráticas se traspasa a los hijos principalmente en forma de una mayor disposición hacia la participación formal y mayor apoyo a la igualdad de género. En contraste, aquellas familias que presentan una mayor orientación hacia la cultura escolar, que se manifiesta en disponer de más libros en el hogar, tienden a generar en sus hijos mayores disposiciones ciudadanas transversales, es decir, esos hijos están dispuestos a participar más y apoyan más la igualdad de derechos para los diferentes grupos sociales. Esto implica que jóvenes que crecen en familias con más recursos literarios en casa estarían más dispuestos a votar, a asistir a una marcha, a ayudar a resolver un problema de su comunidad y/o a apoyar la igualdad de derechos de todos los grupos sociales. Finalmente, confirmando lo argumentado por Schlozman, Verba, \& Brady (2012), las ventajas socioeconómicas se traducen en ventajas para el ejercicio de la ciudadanía por dos vías principalmente: por medio del ambiente político más rico que genera la familia (p.e. nivel de actividad política) y/o la reproducción del estatus familiar hacia la nueva generación, manifestado en la transmisión de habilidades cognitivas necesarias para desarrollar un mayor estatus (p.e. habilidades cívicas y/o conocimiento). Se discuten las principales contribuciones teóricas y empíricas, las principales limitaciones y propuestas de futuras investigación.},

Drawing on survey data collected from 976 young people aged 13–14 in South Wales, we outline the extent and nature of civic participation and how this varies according to relationships with parents and grandparents. Our data show that relationships with mothers and grandparents are particularly important in young people’s accounts of their participation, suggesting that family is far more important in developing a propensity for engagement in civil society than is commonly understood.},

  abstract = {Physical activity is a health relevant factor, particularly in affluent societies where overweight and obesity are increasingly prevalent, even among children. Understanding the development of physical activity patterns in childhood is thus an important issue for health promotion. Following socialization theory, this study describes and explains differences in objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in a socially and ethnically mixed sample of 6- to 11-year-old children in Germany. MVPA levels were objectively measured with accelerometers over the course of six consecutive days (Wednesday to Monday). Parents' attitudes and practices as well as the family's socio-economic status (SES) were assessed from the parents via questionnaires. Results indicate that MVPA levels of children vary with gender, but not with age and ethnicity. Moreover, parental SES, parental support for the child's sports activities, parents' own sport activities and the parents' belief in sports' capacities to foster personality development, character building and social integration significantly predict the MVPA level of children. It is concluded that interventions to promote MVPA among children need to take family interactions and lifestyles into account and should address families in socio-economically underprivileged areas.},

  abstract = {Introduction: How income inequality associates with poorer mental health remains unclear. Personal relative deprivation (PRD) involves appraising oneself as unfairly disadvantaged relative to similar others and has been associated with poorer mental health and negative cognitive appraisals. As generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with negative cognitive appraisals, PRD may relate to the experience of GAD and its cognitive predictors, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), positive beliefs about worry (PBW), negative beliefs about worry (NBW), and experiential avoidance (EA).             Method: In two observational studies (Study 1, N = 588; Study 2, N = 301) participants completed measures of PRD, cognitive predictors and symptoms of GAD, subjective socioeconomic status (SES), self-efficacy, and self-esteem.             Results: A relationship between PRD and GAD was found across studies, which was simultaneously mediated by IU and NBW. These results remained when controlling for subjective SES but were weakened when controlling for self-concept factors.             Discussion: This research supports the possibility that the experience of deprivation may “trap” people in thinking patterns that contribute to anxious symptomology.},

  abstract = {This introductory essay outlines the key themes of the special issue on the long-term impact of autocracies on the political attitudes and behavior of their subjects. Here, we highlight several important areas of theoretical and empirical refinements, which can provide a more nuanced picture of the process through which authoritarian attitudinal legacies emerge and persist. First, we define the nature of attitudinal legacies and their driving mechanisms, developing a framework of competing socialization. Second, we use the competing socialization framework to explain two potential sources of heterogeneity in attitudinal and behavioral legacies: varieties of institutional features of authoritarian regimes, which affect the nature of regime socialization efforts; and variations across different subgroups of (post-)authoritarian citizens, which reflect the nature and strength of alternative socialization efforts. This new framework can help us to better understand contradictory findings in this emerging literature as well as set a new agenda for future research.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing scholarly interest in conceptualising schools beyond their educational functions, as sites and agents of democracy. Yet this interest is often underpinned by a narrow conception of democracy, focusing solely on schools’ public and social aspects. To capture the democratic potential of schools more fully, this article suggests adopting a deliberative systems approach, which conceptualises democracy as differentiated yet linked sites of democratic communications and views schools as one such site. Using this approach as a broader framework and drawing on the fieldwork conducted in two Japanese schools, this article identifies the condition under which schools can become a meaningful part of deliberative systems. It reveals that schools contribute to deliberative systems when they serve as a bridge between children’s everyday practices and deliberative actions in the public space. In light of the findings, this article suggests conceptualising schools as a ‘mediating space’.},

However, regarding meritocratic beliefs, sociologists often argue that meritocratic narratives legitimize and make sense of societal inequalities as justly deserved. Using the case of China, I tested these competing hypotheses of the relationship between parental meritocratic beliefs and children’s educational achievement. Parental beliefs about skills and hard work as predictors of higher grades were used. I analyzed data from the first and second waves of the China Educational Panel Survey. Autoregressive cross-lagged structural models indicated that parental meritocratic beliefs do not affect children’s educational performance but, rather, meritocratic beliefs are affected by academic results, suggesting their justificatory role. This pattern is much sharper in rural China, where traditional Chinese culture is preserved. The implications of meritocratic beliefs for a broader discussion of citizens’ beliefs about social inequalities and stratification are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background/Context: Students' perceptions of justice, fairness, and order within their schools are arguably key building blocks of socialization to participation within a democratic society. The ideals of justice, fairness, and order within their schools are particularly imperative because the educational system is founded on a belief of democracy and meritocracy. It is also known that students' perceptions of school justice can vary by race, ethnicity, and gender. What remains uncertain is how the fastest growing segment of the United States, students in immigrant families, perceive the school justice, fairness, and order within their school. Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore if straight-line assimilation, segmented assimilation, and immigrant optimism hypotheses explain the relationships between schools, justice, and immigration, as well as the potential role of gender, race, and ethnicity in immigrant youth perceptions of justice, fairness, and order. Participants/Subjects: This study utilizes the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), a nationally representative sample of high school sophomores. Research Design: This study's research design includes statistical analysis of secondary data. Findings/Results: Findings do suggest that the students' perceptions of justice, fairness, and order are indeed moderated by immigrant generation, race, ethnicity, and gender. Conclusions/Recommendations: Educators and educational researchers who are seeking to better understand the schooling experiences of immigrant youth might benefit from questioning assimilation and Americanization as processes that inevitably promote educational progress. Given that immigrant youth are and have historically been marginalized within U.S. schools, it appears that socialization, Americanization, gender, and immigrant generational status are germane to creating democratic education for all students. Attentiveness to democratic school justice, order, and fairness is, therefore, imperative.},

Do individual income and repression each have a greater effect than economic inequality? Three prominent theories, namely the Conflict, Relative Power, and Resource Theories address the inequality-participation puzzle in the context of democracies. However, theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for non-democratic regimes are scarce. I argue that it is individual income and the level of repression rather than economic inequality that explain political participation in autocracies. Using three-level hierarchical models that combine micro and macro level data for 65,000 individuals covering a various set of 31 authoritarian regimes and 54 country-years, this analysis demonstrates that higher levels of economic inequality hardly suppress political participation among all citizens. However, individual income has a more powerfully effect on civil society participation, while the level of repression decreases the voting likelihood more powerful than income. These findings suggest that the Resource Theory generates the greatest empirical support for autocracies.},

Class climate was assessed in terms of two second-order dimensions: classroom climate (e.g., willingness to learn) and student climate (e.g., community). Multilevel analyses revealed that the more the students evaluated their teachers' behavior toward them personally to be just, the more positively they evaluated the classroom and student climate. Moreover, students with a strong BJW tended to evaluate their teachers' behavior toward them personally to be more just and the climate of their class to be more positive. Furthermore, the experience of teacher justice partly mediated the BJW's effect on the climate evaluations. Thus, a strong BJW seems to function as a personal resource for students, explaining significant parts of their individual experience of both teacher justice and class climate at school. Most importantly, individually experienced teacher justice seems to be a significant factor when it comes to understanding class climate. Implications are discussed.},

We report on an effectiveness evaluation of a YPAR project designed to promote European active citizenship (i.e., identification and attitudes toward a political entity, institutional trust, participation, and political alienation) and social well-being among adolescents. Our sample included 69 Italian high school students (35 in the intervention group; 34 in the control group). We evaluated the impact of YPAR using a pretest–posttest control group design and fitting the generalized estimating equations procedure. The results showed that participants in the intervention group reported increased scores on social well-being, institutional trust, and participation and decreased scores on political alienation compared with the control group. We found no significant effects for identification as European and attitudes toward a political entity. Findings support the benefits of YPAR in terms of social well-being and active citizenship.},

Thus the ethnic majority can champion ethnic minority inclusion without risking ethnic equality. The article therefore challenges a core capitalist assumption, that the market is `the perfect arbiter' and rewards on merit, by underlining the `ethnocratic' context of Israeli hi-tech's meritocracy: while the liberal citizenship discourse enables the ethnic minority to claim citizenship through economic participation, it cannot be separated in practice from an ethnonational citizenship discourse because ostensibly liberal spaces are infused with ethnonational meaning.},

We further examined a potential mechanism underlying this relationship, namely general trust, and hypothesized that the relationship between justice experiences in school and democratic attitudes can be understood on the basis of social exchange theory. A total of 210 participants who had visited a public school gave information about their justice experiences in school, general trust, and democratic attitudes. First, it was shown that overall experiences of distributive and interactional justice predict democratic attitudes, more specifically the approval of civic and human rights and the approval of the democratic institutions. Second, we found that the relationships between overall distributive and interactional justice and the approval of civic and human rights, the approval of the democratic institutions, and the approval of democracy-supporting behaviors are each mediated by general trust which can be interpreted as a social exchange process. This study therefore highlights the role of general justice-related school experiences for the development of democratic attitudes.},

In total, 196 students participated in this study and came to the university with their classes to receive extra teaching once a week for six consecutive weeks. To manipulate justice perceptions, a scenario of arbitrary privilege was chosen to lead students of the experimental group to experience injustice from a beneficiary perspective. We found that students in the experimental group reported higher well-being and a higher appreciation of the opportunity to learn than the control group did. Additionally, they showed an increase in justice-related negative emotions over time; that is, they expressed more of a bad conscience and stronger feelings of anger the more they became aware of their privilege. This study shows that even subtle experiences of injustice in school can have an impact on students’ outcomes. These results are discussed with regard to practical implications.}

Post-conflict societies experience severe challenges in strengthening political processes and social cohesion. This paper discusses citizenship education at a school run by a non-governmental organization near Monrovia, Liberia, examining the implemented curriculum in an 8th grade civics classroom. The paper details the ways that young people expressed civic critiques within the classroom, and provides a counterstory to narratives of harsh and violent educational environments in the region. This classroom was a space where students and their teacher engaged in talk about contentious issues: students discussed corruption and injustice, and highlighted the relationship between economic and political power. I argue that if the goal of education is to produce engaged, effective citizens, teachers should have pedagogic support to confront the differences between the implemented curriculum and students' lived experiences. Peace education in such contexts must include equipping students to seek justice. Furthermore, because possibilities for civic education are embedded in students' local and national contexts, current global civic education initiatives must be adaptive to local realities.},

Therefore, political sociologists have advised to socialize people by encouraging political participation from a young age onward. Parents are one of the most important political socialization agents, especially at a young age. Although the intergenerational transmission of political attitudes has been studied quite intensively, the transmission of the political participation intention has been neglected. This study explores the effect of both mothers' and fathers' political activity on their offspring's intention to participate. Using a data set from 2085 Belgian parent–child triads, we tested the direct and indirect transmission of political participation intention. We found that although there is a direct transmission of political participation intention, after controlling for political discussion, political interest and socio-economic status, this effect is completely mediated. Therefore, we conclude that intergenerational transmission is an indirect process, supported by a high socio-economic status, more political interest and a more politicized family environment in which politics is clearly perceived as salient.},

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 17 middle-class and working-class and poor Mexican American parents, we explore social class patterns in childrearing practices and beliefs. Rather than stark-class differences found in previous work, we observed substantial similarities across social class lines. Our findings suggest that (1) Social mobility experienced by middle-class parents complicate class-based parenting beliefs.

  abstract = {Conceptualizing fairness through social psychology theory has recently been called for in classroom assessment (CA) literature. This study used two open-ended questionnaires to explore university students' critical incidents of fairness and unfairness and their affective and behavioral reactions to experiences of un/fairness. The findings showed that students' perceptions of CA fairness were comprised of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice principles. Collectively, students considered the distribution of outcomes, the procedures for outcome distributions, the interpersonal relationships, and the communication procedures in conceptualizing fairness. Students also reported positive feelings such as happiness, satisfaction, feeling valued, and hopefulness when describing fair incidents, while they tended to report negative feelings such as anger, upset, disappointment, and embarrassment as responses to unfair incidents. Students also reported increased classroom engagement and greater adaptation in responses to fairness incidents, while they reported class disengagement, inaction, and dissent as responses to unfair incidents. Building on these empirical findings, a more comprehensive conceptualization of fairness in CA contexts is proposed.},

In Australia, policy initiatives have addressed concerns about the low levels of political knowledge among young people. Yet research about how young Australians acquire political knowledge, beyond schools, is scarce. The present study referring to the concepts of situated learning, self-determination and knowledge gap, asks whether young adult’s participatory practices (e.g., participation in politics, prior involvement in decision-making at school) predict political knowledge. Analyses that control for multiple predictors of political knowledge suggest differential associations between political knowledge and different participatory practices. Motivational inequality, as defined by interest in politics, moderates the associations with party-political participation and participation at school; the conditional effect of party-related political participation is further moderated by educational resources. Gendered differences are identified for some participatory practices. Directions for future research and the importance of participatory experiences and how to establish a foundation of young citizens’ political knowledge are discussed.},

In this investigation, we focus on gender differentials in sense of justice about grades, comparing high school students in two educational settings: Israel and Germany. Although the strong norm of equitable distribution of grades would predict no gender differentials in grade allocation, the pattern of results suggest that gender plays a role in both the distribution of this reward and the judgment of fair distribution, therefore affecting students' sense of (in)justice. Similarities as well as certain differences in the comparison of sense of justice of Israeli and German boys and girls are discussed in light of system-specific features.},

The possibility that class composition is a referential structure influencing both actual reward allocation and the determination of entitlement is discussed and investigated empirically in a sample of over 9,000 Israeli junior high students with regard to two academic rewards: grades and ability group placement.

Findings suggest that (a) a teacher’s decision is based on a weighted combination of multi-principles of allocation, (b) equity by output (students proved academic success) is the ruling consideration, and (c) the weight given to the various considerations differ by teachers’ subject matter expertise. The appeared difference placed science teachers vis-à-vis math and language teachers, unlike the expected humanities (language)—sciences (math and science) dichotomy. Comparison of grading considerations by student capacity suggests that about half of the teachers consider differential grading considerations for “weak” and “strong” students as just, attributing greater weight to academic input (effort) and need for encouragement when grading their “weak” students.},

The study was carried out among about 5,000 8th- and 9th-grade students in a national sample of 48 junior high schools in Israel in the 2010–2011 school year. The two-level data—individual and school—were analyzed by the hierarchical linear model (HLM7) program. Findings basically support our hypotheses: sense of distributive instrumental and, especially, of relational justice at school have a positive effect on liberal democratic orientation and on trust in people and in formal institutions. Furthermore, school (aggregate) sense of procedural justice adds to these positive effects and, in the case of democratic orientation, also interacts with instrumental justice and intensifies its effect on this outcome. However, these attitudes are also dependent on sectorial affiliation (Jewish secular, Jewish religious, Israeli–Arab), which explains a considerable portion of between-school variation in student attitudes.},

This is especially the case in democratic societies, which are based on citizens' participation. Hence, education for citizenship is uniformly considered as a major mission of the common school, along with its central task of imparting knowledge. In this paper we add to the abundant empirical work on the contributing factors to and behavioral consequences of civic education, focusing on the role of the students' sense of justice in school. We refine previous approaches by distinguishing among three dimensions of the sense of justice, two pertaining to the distributive, and one to the procedural justice. We investigate the effects of these dimensions on four kinds of civic behavior relevant to school life: academic dishonesty, violence, extracurricular activity in school and community volunteering. The study was carried out among about 5000 Israeli middle school students (8th and 9th grades). Findings suggest that, overall, students who perceive their teachers as just tend to refrain from violence and to engage to a greater extent in extra-curricular school activity and community volunteering.},

Inequality aversion, stratification beliefs, perceptions of class tensions and legitimate earnings are tracked, together with support for government redistribution and for specific redress policies. Overall, the findings portray South Africans as keenly aware of the economic inequality that beleaguers their society, and express a preference for greater distributive fairness. Broad support is also reported in relation to state-led redistribution, though a moderate declining trend is observed over the interval. Race and class differences characterise the survey results, though a majority of better-off South Africans (white, tertiary educated and non-poor citizens) still tend to be inequality averse and voice support for redistribution. Greater polarisation is evident with respect to inequality-related social policy, especially those designed to overcome historical racial disadvantage, though these intergroup differences converge considerably when referring to class-based policy measures. One surprising finding is the evidence that South Africa's youngest generation, known as the `Born Frees', tend to adopt a similar predisposition to redress policy as older generations, thus confounding expectations of a post-apartheid value change. Nonetheless, even though South Africans may not fully agree about the specific elements comprising a socially just response to the country's inequality problem, there does seem to be a stronger basis for a social compact for an inequality reduction agenda than is typically assumed.},

Besides this, attitudes towards income inequality are influenced by inequality-legitimising myths in a given society. Little is known about how these two factors interact. This study combines these two lines of research and argues that different social strata are more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies with strong prevalent meritocratic perceptions. We expect lower-status individuals (i.e. with a lower income or education) to experience a threat to their group esteem and therefore be less likely to support their society's inequalities in societies with such strong meritocratic perceptions. This hypothesis was tested using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2009 (Social Inequality) on 39 countries. The results show that different social strata are indeed more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies where meritocratic perceptions are more prevalent. Our results are robust for income, but not for education. This suggests that in perceived meritocracies, people regard income as the primary indicator of effort and ability.},

The authors ask to what extent resource-specific justice perceptions vary across two national groups of teachers (Jewish and Arab) in the Israeli population and educational system. Their findings indicate that Israeli teachers across sectors prefer differentiation (favoring equity over equality/need) and perceive more injustice when universalistic, rather than particularistic resources are at stake. At the same time, justice perceptions were found to vary across sectorial/cultural lines. For instance, Israeli-Arab teachers preferred differentiation of particularistic resources more strongly than their Israeli-Jewish counterparts. Sabbagh and Malka suggest that cross-cultural and cross-sectional research may provide a clearer understanding of patterns of convergence and divergence in the meanings assigned to social resources and of the corresponding distribution rules.},

Specifically, it investigates the extent to which Druze and Jewish students in Israel differ in their evaluations of the types of distribution rules that are actually and ideally preferred by teachers when they assign grades. Findings revealed that in both Jewish and Druze groups the achievement rules were ranked highest in terms of the actual and ideal ways of determining their grades. These were followed by the personality rules, and lastly by the ascriptive/particularistic rules. Thus, students in these groups share to a large extent their view about the actual and ideal grading practices. At the same time, Jewish students, who live in a market-driven society characterized by individual and competitive relations, ascribe stronger importance to meritocratic rules. In contrast, Druze students, who live in a highly homogeneous environment based on ascriptive status and solidarity relations, have a greater tendency than Jews to think that grading should be guided by particularistic/ascriptive types of rules. A structural analysis of grade distribution rule preferences revealed that they were similarly measured across groups.},

Moving from the macro to micro level, we identify the following five areas: the right to education, the allocation of (or selection into) learning places, teaching–learning practices, teachers' treatment of students, and student evaluations of grade distribution. We discuss the literature on the beliefs by students and teachers about the just distribution of educational goods in these five domains, and on the practices used in the actual allocation of these goods. In line with normative `spheres of justice' arguments in social theory, we conclude that the ideals of social justice within schools vary strongly according to the particular resource to be distributed. Moreover, these ideals often do not correspond with the practices that actually guide resource distribution in education, which may go some way toward explaining explicit or latent conflicts in this sphere.},

In Study 2, middle school teachers (N=87) were asked to judge the academic success (social utility) and perceived likeability (social desirability) of students described as high versus low on effort and competence. Results showed that participants judged effort as being more important for academic success than competence, especially concerning participants showing high levels of meritocratic beliefs (Study 1). Despite this normative value of effort, effort was judged less predictive of academic success than competence, suggesting a low social value of effort with regard to social utility. A reversed pattern was observed for social desirability.},

  abstract = {Faculty mentorship is a highly advantageous yet under-explored form of social capital which can grant access to co-curriculars (e.g., research assistantships), ensure strong letters of recommendation, and more. It is also typically informal and dependent on student initiative, requiring that students be skilled at engaging educational authority figures. Privileged students are most likely to have such skills as part of their dominant cultural capital, making faculty mentorship a site of social reproduction. To explore variations in this process, I compare two institution types: a small, teaching/undergraduate-focused regional university and a large, research-intensive flagship. In interviews with 68 working- and upper-middle-class students, I find that college context mediates the relationship of class background and faculty mentorship. Upper-middle-class students fostered advantageous faculty relationships at both universities, but working-class students diverged: at the flagship, they rarely approached professors in search of mentorship, while those at the regional university described close, beneficial connections with professors. I discuss working-class students' dissimilar experiences in terms of each university's structural and cultural characteristics (organizational habitus), particularly their institutional focus and size. I argue that through their particular organizational features, colleges can both reproduce and reduce inequalities, challenging the determinacy of precollege socialization in education.},

Our review shows that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by the evidence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing policies. Likewise, voter preferences for the redistribution of wealth depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures, and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair. Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic process is captured by the rich; however, the evidence explaining when, where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful avenue for future research.},

  abstract = {Political trust ???the trust that people place in political institutions- seems to be critical for democracy. However, there is no agreement as to what the origins of trust are. What makes citizens trust or distrust their main political institutions? How can we explain the differences found across and within countries? These are the main questions driving this dissertation. The central hypotheses of this study are (1) that we can found differences in levels of political trust both within and across countries, (2) that, at the individual level, political trust is related mainly to perceptions of fairness and competence of national governing institutions, and (3) that, at the country level, political trust is mostly explained by different levels of corruption. In order to evaluate these claims, I analyzed political trust data from the World Values Survey of 50 democracies of the industrialized world, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. To evaluate country differences I used these 50 democracies. To evaluate individual differences and the individual-level correlates of trust, I focused on seven Latin American countries. The results show that, at the country-level, political trust is higher among the most developed democracies and in those countries with longer democratic traditions, parliamentary governments and majoritarian electoral systems. These variables loose relevance and statistical power, however, when the country level of corruption is introduced. Corruption is, according to the results obtained, the major factor in explaining average levels of political trust. At the individual level data, in an analysis of Latin American citizens, we found that the most important factors explaining variations in political trust are those related to the perceptions of fairness and competence of their government institutions. Trust is considerably higher when institutions are considered fair and competent in their actions. Political trust is important for governments. And citizens decide when to grant trust to their political institutions as a response to a multiplicity of factors, of which the level of corruption and the perceptions of institutional fairness and competence are among the most important ones.},

Two waves of longitudinal survey data from 768 Czech high school students (T1 mean age 15.97) were analyzed using latent transition analysis. Results suggested three basic patterns of adolescents' views on democracy: majority-oriented (disregarding minority rights and interests), conventional (having narrowed understanding of civil liberties), and liberal (supporting both minority rights and civil liberties). Of these, the liberal view pattern was the least stable over time, and its stability was linked to adolescents' institutional trust and civic participation. Specifically, adolescents who were less trusting of institutions were more likely to adopt the majority-oriented (vs. liberal) view, while less civically active adolescents were more likely to switch to the conventional view. Authoritarianism was linked to adolescents' initial views, but it did not predict change over time. © 2019},

Although a unique collection because it reflects the diversity that exists among major researchers in the field, it evinces a common theme -- that the ideas parents have regarding their children and themselves as parents have an impact on their actions. This emphasis on parents' ideas shifts the focus on sources of family influence to ideas or beliefs as determinants of family interactions. The implication of this way of thinking for practitioners is that it suggests the shift to ideas and thoughts from behavior and attitudes.},

Age differences in attributions for outcomes reflected a strengthening with age of the skill–luck distinction and of equity thinking about wealth. Although men with good outcomes were generally perceived more positively than men with bad outcomes, and likeability was affected only by outcome, 10-year-olds differentiated most sharply among different types of ‘winners’ or ‘losers’, viewing the rich and poor men as more like the winner and loser of a contest of skill than like the winner and loser of a game of chance. Overall, the findings suggest that differential evaluation of rich and poor people may begin as affective tagging based on good or bad life outcomes and later be associated with justifications grounded in an equity perspective on income inequality that emphasizes the role of personal qualities such as ability in wealth accumulation.},

Fairness is an everyday term, which in policy hides multiple and contradictory positions across the political divide. In education, we find a policy context that focuses on distributional justice and equality of opportunity but also on principles of freedom and choice. This paper argues that engaging with how young people understand fairness contributes to models of social justice in education. Focus group data and written statements on fairness from approximately 80 young people aged 16-18 from five very different English schools were analysed. Students' primary concerns, absent from educational policy, were the themes of relational justice and stakes fairness, which are eclipsed by current recourse to distributive justice and meritocratic ideals. We argue that a focus on the lived experience of fairness is therefore necessary to widen the discourse about what is fair in education and to reinvigorate public debate about the values on which our education system is based.},

A prominent recent study by Newman, Johnston, and Lown argues that, consistent with the conflict theory, exposure to higher levels of local income inequality leads lower-income people to become more likely to reject—and higher-income people to become more likely to accept—the dominant United States ideology of meritocracy. Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the study’s own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three distinctly different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis. We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion. Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.},

Our analysis shows that generalized trust is higher among older adolescents. However, despite this maturing effect, youth exposed to greater levels of socioeconomic diversity have significantly lower levels of trust. The effect is particularly acute for students in the ninth grade controlling for community diversity and polarization. The result reinforces the idea that generalized trust develops early in one's life and is quite stable, although a major life transformation, such as entering high school, may alter trust depending on the social context.},

  abstract = {The 1990 World Values Survey demonstrated that industrialization promotes a shift from traditional to secular-rational values. Drawing data from a sample survey of 2,350 respondents in Shanghai, this study examines the impact of social change on people's values in China. Specifically, we are interested in (1) are there significant differences in values between different generations in China? (2) Do younger generations tend to have more modern values? (3) What are the main factors that affect the differences? The results show that the younger generations in China have already shifted from traditional values to modern values in a recent social transformation process. In addition, the younger generations tend to be more secular. They are more likely to regard self-development as the most important thing in life rather than making contributions to the country and society. Further, the younger generations are more individualistic than the old generations. They are more likely to live according to their own lifestyles regardless of what others think. Thus, they are less likely to follow the traditional collective ideology. Overall, the study shows significant generational gaps in value orientations in China.},

  abstract = {Legitimacy is a problem of contemporary governance. Communities lack trust in elected officials-in their effectiveness, fairness, and representation of the public interest. Participatory budgeting (PB)-a set of democratic processes where residents determine how to spend a public budget-helps bridge that distance by letting the public make spending decisions. Since 2011, some of New York City's (NYC) council members have been implementing PB with their capital budget-setting aside a million dollars in their districts each budget cycle for PB. Participatory budgeting has the potential to rebuild relationships between government and communities. Using data from over eighty interviews conducted by New York University (NYU) graduate students in 2013 and 2014 with PBNYC participants over two years, this article suggests that in council districts using PB, residents have greater feelings of access to and voice in local government, and better understanding of the complexities of spending public monies, often leading to a more positive view of government officials, and bolstering legitimacy of local government.},

Among all available cultural ideas, which ones do parents select for transmission? As the recent normative approaches in cultural psychology highlight, cultural members do not just passively act out their internalized characteristics; they also strategically use their understanding of the culture’s norms to guide their actions. This essay elaborates the implications of these approaches for understanding intergenerational cultural transmission. The perceived norms perspective is introduced. This perspective premises that when selecting cultural ideas for transmission, parents consider not only their own orientations but also their perceptions of what is normatively important in the culture. It further states that parents’ reference to perceived norms is directed by the goals they hold. This essay discusses the contributions of this perspective to the study of intergenerational cultural transmission and identifies some directions for future research.},

Estudiantes con experiencias democráticas en el colegio y con temas internacionales tienen una asociación positiva con sus conocimientos de derechos humanos. Diferencia significativa en género también existe. Mirando a la vez actitudes relacionadas con derechos, los estudiantes con más conocimiento de derechos humanos, compromiso más frecuente en temas internacionales y aulas más abiertas, los climas escolares mantuvieron normas más estrictas que apoyaban la ciudadanía del movimiento social, tenían actitudes más positivas hacia los derechos de los inmigrantes y fueron más eficaces políticamente.

When income differences are perceived to be high, the public thinks of larger income inequality as legitimate. The phenomenon is explained by the system justification motivation and other psychological processes that favor existing social arrangements. Three experiments show that personal experiences of inequality as well as information regarding national-level income inequality can affect which income differences are thought of as legitimate. A fourth experiment shows that the system justification motivation is a cause of this effect. These results can provide an empirical basis for future studies to assume that the public reacts to inequality with adapted expectations, not increased demands for redistribution.},

Feelings of social exclusion, however, may be the result of psychological processes and in particular of (in)justice experiences. Based on just-world research, we hypothesized that (1) the more young people feel treated justly by parents, peers, and teachers and (2) the stronger their personal belief in a just world (BJW), the less they should feel socially excluded, and (3) their justice experiences mediate the effect of the personal BJW. In this article, we analyze the data from two late-adolescent samples to test these hypotheses (Study 1: N = 142 students from two academic-track secondary schools; Study 2: N = 154 students aiming for vocational or intermediate degrees). Hierarchical regression analyses consistently revealed that (a) psychological factors significantly explained feelings of social exclusion, whereas sociological factors did so only marginally, and (b) justice experiences significantly explained feelings of exclusion and (c) fully mediated the effect of the personal BJW. Results further suggest that the feelings of exclusion can be meaningfully categorized according to the context (e.g., society in general vs. school) and that context-related feelings of exclusion can be explained by different justice experiences.},

The outcome consisted of AE cases diagnosed over the period 1980-1992. High vole density yielded a 10-fold risk (relative risk [RR] = 10.34, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.78-38.39), and the first plateau (400-700 m altitude) compared with the plain (200-400 m) was associated with a large increase in risk (RR = 7.10, 95\% CI = 1.30-38.63). These results confirm that human AE is strongly influenced by the densities of arvicolid species. Foxes feeding almost exclusively on grassland rodents when the latter expand could mediate this relation.},

  abstract = {Given the frequent critiques of elite universities for admitting low numbers of state school graduates and, more recently, British Afro-Caribbean students, how do students attending those universities make meaning of the admissions process? Through an analysis of 46 one-on-one in-depth interviews with undergraduates attending Oxford University, we show that students believe in the fairness of the admissions process, while lamenting the lack of opportunities for educational advancement faced by some disadvantaged youth in British society. Despite their understanding that many British youth do not have access to educational experiences that make Oxbridge an attainable goal, most students do not support changes to make access more equitable across class or racial/ethnic lines. This perspective, which legitimates the status students gain through matriculation at an elite university, supports the maintenance of unequal access to an Oxford education despite the advantages that education is known to confer to graduates. The findings demonstrate elites acknowledging the disadvantages of particular groups in society without acknowledging their own advantages in the same system. They do so by recognizing two elements of merit: (1) intelligence, which most students assumed led to their own admission; and (2) cultivation of that intelligence, which requires elite secondary schools and which most students see as disadvantaging particular groups in society. In the paper we highlight differences in meaning-making between graduates of grammar, comprehensive and private schools.},

Based on these theories, we hypothesized that students’ perceptions of their teachers as autonomy supportive, mainly in the form of encouragement of critical thinking, and perhaps also choice, would be positively associated with students’ advanced moral judgment. Data collected from 12th grade students in two regular schools and two democratic schools supported this hypothesis. Results also showed that being a student in a democratic school (as opposed to a regular one) was associated with autonomous moral judgment, and that this association was mediated by students’ perceptions of teachers as encouraging criticism, but not choice. A possible implication is that programs of moral education should explicitly promote teachers’ inclination to encourage critical thinking in their students.},

In the present paper, we argue that because merit is the only track for low status students to reach upward mobility, Belief in School Meritocracy (BSM) is a particularly useful system-justifying tool to help them perceive their place in society as being deserved. Consequently, for low status students (but not high status students), this belief should be related to more general system-justifying beliefs (Study 1). Moreover, low status students should be particularly prone to endorsing this belief when their place within a system on which they strongly depend to acquire status is challenged (Study 2). In Study 1, high status (boys and high SES) were compared to low status (girls and low SES) high school students. Results indicated that BSM was related to system-justifying beliefs only for low SES students and for girls, but not for high SES students or for boys. In Study 2, university students were exposed (or not) to information about an important selection process that occurs at the university, depending on the condition. Their subjective status was assessed. Although such a confrontation reduced BSM for high subjective SES students, it tended to enhance it for low subjective SES students. Results are discussed in terms of system-justification motives and the palliative function meritocratic ideology may play for low status students.},

Because this Handbook is for the educational psychology audience, we focus primarily on changes in adolescents' cognition and motivation, and how these changes influence adolescents' achievement. We also consider briefly the important biological changes that occur at adolescence. We take an interactionist approach in this chapter, as we believe adolescent development reflects changes within the individual, as well as changes in the environments and relationships adolescents experience. Thus we discuss changes in the major contexts and relationships in adolescents' lives, including the peer group, the family, and school. Within many of the sections we discuss gender and ethnic differences in the psychological constructs and contexts discussed. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that adolescence is very much a cultural phenomenon, and the experiences adolescents have vary greatly across different cultures. We focus in this chapter primarily on adolescent development in the United States. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)}

  abstract = {In this article, we examine conceptualisations of luck evoked by a select group of elite students studying in Oxbridge, when accounting for their academic success. The emphasis on luck in their narratives is categorised into three themes. The students linked their luckiness to deservedness, used luck as a way to express humbleness, and attributed their success to factors of chance. These themes are analysed against the backdrop of strong institutional support they receive as part of attending elite schools and being scholarship recipients. By being attentive to how luck is evoked in these narratives, we show that luck does not have an essential meaning and can produce different representations of legitimacy. The paper proposes the integration between critical and pragmatic sociological perspectives in order to advance our understandings of how elite groups qualify for the positions they obtain, how they define themselves and make sense of their educational merits.},

  abstract = {Emboldened by the rise of China, a meritocratic trend has surged in recent Confucian political theory. Confucian meritocracy is upheld as an equally viable alternative, if not a superior one, to democracy because many think that the latter's populist vices do not exist in the former's hierarchical, managerial political structure. This article addresses this seemingly dichotomous relationship between democracy and Confucian meritocracy by drawing on Zhu Xi (1130-1200 AD). I demonstrate those overlooked egalitarian qualities inherent in Confucian meritocracy, which can render itnaturally compatiblewith democracy. Thus, an accurate understanding of Confucian meritocracy requires us not to see it as an opposite of democracy. Rather, Confucian meritocracy actually fosters moral growth in the populace by encouraging them to participate in politics under the instruction of their political leaders, who are to be guided by two egalitarian pedagogical principles, that is, universal inclusion and student participation.},

  abstract = {Trust in Political Institutions (TIPI) is important for political stability as well as political change. We integrate two theories into the conceptualisation of political socialisations of students with and without immigration backgrounds: The theory of social capital conceptualises trust as a generalisation of positive social relationships, whereas the theory of the critical citizen implies that institutions need knowledgeable and scrutinising citizens for democratic improvements. This paper investigates the role of the school setting for political socialisation concerning TIPI using weighted German data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 (N = 1451 students in 59 classes; 52\% were girls; mean age was 14.29; 40\% of participants had immigration backgrounds). Students with immigration backgrounds reported relatively worse social relationships and bestowed less TIPI compared to their peers without immigration backgrounds. As predicted by the theory of social capital, all groups of students bestowed more TIPI if they experienced positive relationships at school to a higher degree. A weaker predictive power of civic knowledge on TIPI for students with immigration background supports notions of the critical citizen. Results indicate that social relationships are relevant for the formation of TIPI of all students, while the role of civic knowledge varies between social groups.},
