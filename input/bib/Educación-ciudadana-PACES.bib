  abstract = {In this review, I provide an overview of the literature investigating the social psychology of economic inequality, focusing on individuals' understandings, perceptions, and reactions to inequality. I begin by describing different ways of measuring perceptions of inequality, and conclude that absolute measures\textemdash which ask respondents to estimate inequality in more concrete terms\textemdash tend to be more useful and accurate than relative measures. I then describe how people understand inequality, highlighting the roles of cognitive heuristics, accessibility of information, self-interest, and context and culture. I review the evidence regarding how people react to inequality, suggesting that inequality is associated with higher well-being in developing nations but lower well-being in developed nations, mostly because of hopes or fears for the future. The evidence from developed nations suggests that inequality increases individuals' concerns about status and economic resources, increases their perception that the social world is competitive and individualistic, and erodes their faith in others, political systems, and democracy in general.},

Citizens who perceive on basis of past experiences that they are being treated fairly by authorities have been held to have greater trust in political institutions. However, previous studies on the relationship between procedural fairness and political trust have not paid sufficient attention to individuals with limited first-hand experiences of authorities. We examine the relationship on an authority that virtually all individuals meet early in life: the school. Using structural equation modeling on unique panel data covering 1500 Swedish adolescents (ages ranging from 13 to 17), we find a reciprocal relationship: personal encounters with school authorities shape young people's political trust; however, the images that adolescents get of the political system (through family, peers, media and so on) have also consequences on their perceptions about the authorities they encounter in their daily lives. The analysis increases our understanding of how individuals form their political allegiances by showing that the relationship between fairness and trust is more dynamic than has previously been suggested: neither an accumulated set of experiences of authorities nor formal ties with political institutions (as voters and so on) are required for a relationship to emerge.},

  abstract = {The role of 'fair' institutions in developing democratic legitimacy has received increased attention. Citizens who perceive on basis of past experiences that they are being treated fairly by authorities have been held to have greater trust in political institutions. However, previous studies on the relationship between procedural fairness and political trust have not paid sufficient attention to individuals with limited first-hand experiences of authorities. We examine the relationship on an authority that virtually all individuals meet early in life: the school. Using structural equation modeling on unique panel data covering 1500 Swedish adolescents (ages ranging from 13 to 17), we find a reciprocal relationship: personal encounters with school authorities shape young people's political trust; however, the images that adolescents get of the political system (through family, peers, media and so on) have also consequences on their perceptions about the authorities they encounter in their daily lives. The analysis increases our understanding of how individuals form their political allegiances by showing that the relationship between fairness and trust is more dynamic than has previously been suggested: neither an accumulated set of experiences of authorities nor formal ties with political institutions (as voters and so on) are required for a relationship to emerge.},

Bringing together different sociologic traditions, the framework draws upon Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and practices, balanced with recent research on life histories, globalization and individualization. The life stories of 52 workers produced in the context of an adult education programme are analysed, focusing on two major topics: life pathways and class trajectories, and subjectivity, identity and values (stressing the weak class consciousness). The article discusses the potentialities/challenges of using the biographical method to study socialization and inequalities, particularly when developed in educational contexts. According to the analysis, life pathways are often branded by temporary rural, industrial and services work experiences, crossed by turning points' and dramatic moments, though with some generational and gender differences. Classes are seldom referred to, but narratives are framed by key socialization institutions (work, family, local community, church, army) and a sense of deficit, pride and shame, linked to the inequalities structure. Although a pervasive economic, cultural and political change from the 1960s on is evident, our research found key features of a working-class habitus, rooted in specific life paths and socialization institutions. These are likely to be stretched in the current context of economic crisis and neoliberal policies in southern Europe.},

This article explores the gains from a biographical approach to researching learning and education, with reference to empirical data. It also highlights the systematic restrictions that accompany such a perspective. The authors thus suggest widening biographical research on education by applying the concept of socialisation as a methodological basis. By focusing on all biographical processes, such an approach generates insights on how some of these processes can be detrimental to biographical learning and education. The authors argue that this specific paradigm is suitable for investigating the relationship between education and social inequality at a micro-analytical level.},

The article attempts to balance this bias. The aim is to introduce and argue for another normative approach \textendash{} situational political socialization. Four theoretical elements constitute its basis: (1) the political, (2) contingency (the principle of the public sphere), (3) space and place, and (4) situation. In the contingent western digital media society marked by cultural dissemination, individualism, and the erosion of traditional institutions, situational political socialization represents a normative basis for a research approach which is open, action-oriented and contextualized, viewing young people as political actors in their own right.},

  abstract = {Resumen Este art\'iculo discute la importancia y centralidad que ha adquirido el m\'erito en la sociedad chilena hoy, enfoc\'andose principalmente en sus efectos asociados con la experiencia educacional. El argumento es desarrollado en tres pasos. Luego de una presentaci\'on del contexto hist\'orico y de las transformaciones sociales que dan cuenta de su expansi\'on, se analizan sobre todo las maneras en que el reconocimiento del m\'erito es distintamente evaluado en las diferentes etapas de la trayectoria escolar por las clases medias y los sectores populares. En un tercer momento, se muestra de qu\'e manera a trav\'es del extendido recurso a las redes sociales y a los contactos interpersonales, la expansi\'on del m\'erito se acompa\~na del surgimiento de un nuevo horizonte de injusticia social. El art\'iculo pone en evidencia, as\'i, a la vez el fuerte consenso en torno al valor del m\'erito en Chile y los sentimientos de injusticia y frustraci\'on que ello engendra en los individuos. La discusi\'on presentada se basa en los resultados de dos estudios cualitativos. La primera investigaci\'on se desarroll\'o en las ciudades de Santiago, Concepci\'on y Valpara\'iso, entre 2007 y 2009, a trav\'es de alrededor de un centenar de entrevistas a hombres y mujeres de entre 30 y 55 a\~nos, pertenecientes la mitad de ellos a sectores populares urbanos y la otra mitad a las clases medias y medias-altas. La segunda investigaci\'on, en curso, aport\'o al an\'alisis diecis\'eis entrevistas hechas en Santiago, a lo largo del 2014, a partir de las cuales se profundiz\'o la problem\'atica del m\'erito.            ,               Abstract This article discusses the importance and centrality that merit has in Chilean society today, focusing on its multidirectional relationships to the educational realm. Our argument will be developed in three steps. Firstly, we will present the historical context of the social transformations that are to be related with the expansion of the principle of merit in this society. Secondly, we will analyze the manners in which the recognition of merit is evaluated at each of the different stages of school trajectories by members of middle and popular sectors. Finally, we will describe and discuss the way in which, due to the maintained impact of social networks and interpersonal contacts, the expansion of merit is closely related to the emergence of a new horizon of social injustice. Consequently, the article evidences that, concerning the expansion of the principle of merit in Chile, we face a twofold process: the emergence of a strong consensus about the value of merit, and the widespread sentiments of injustice and frustration that it produces in individuals. This discussion is based upon the findings of two qualitative studies. The first one was developed between 2007 and 2009 in Santiago, Concepci\'on and Valpara\'iso cities, in Chile. About one hundred interviews were held with men and women aged 30 to 55 years of middle and popular sectors. The second, an ongoing study, provided our analysis with sixteen interviews, which were carried out in Santiago in 2014, and enabled us to further analyze the merit theme.},

  abstract = {The theory of broad and narrow socialization is described, with a particular emphasis on placing family socialization in its cultural context. In cultures characterized by broad socialization, socialization is intended to promote independence, individualism, and self-expression. In contrast, cultures with narrow socialization hold obedience and conformity as their highest values. Seven sources of socialization are described, including family, peers, school/work, community, the media, the legal system, and the cultural belief system. Other considerations are discussed, including variation within cultures (such as gender differences) and the place of attachments. In addition, two examples of applications of the theory are provided.},

Este estudio busc\'o comprender la participaci\'on escolar, desde las voces de los estudiantes, en dos escuelas con alta calidad de convivencia escolar y dos escuelas con baja calidad de la convivencia escolar, seleccionadas seg\'un un \'indice creado a partir de encuestas a estudiantes. Con base en un dise\~no cualitativo, se realizaron entrevistas semiestructuradas grupales a 70 estudiantes de octavo a\~no b\'asico. Los resultados indican que en todas las escuelas la participaci\'on de los estudiantes es tutelada e instrumentalmente dirigida por los adultos de la escuela, heteronormativa, selectiva e inestable. Las diferencias entre las escuelas con alta y baja calidad de convivencia escolar es que las primeras limitan la participaci\'on no convencional de los estudiantes ligada a la movilizaci\'on estudiantil extraescuela, y amenazan a los estudiantes con intereses pol\'iticos. Se discute la constituci\'on de una subjetividad estudiantil pasiva y dependiente al interior del establecimiento educacional, y activa y comprometida al exterior del mismo, as\'i como la noci\'on misma de convivencia escolar, que pareciera ser de car\'acter disciplinar.},

  abstract = {Educational institutions are considered a keystone for the establishment of a meritocratic society. They supposedly serve two functions: an educational function that promotes learning for all, and a selection function that sorts individuals into different programs, and ultimately social positions, based on individual merit. We study how the function of selection relates to support for assessment practices known to harm vs. benefit lower status students, through the perceived justice principles underlying these practices. We study two assessment practices: normative assessment focused on ranking and social comparison, known to hinder the success of lower status students and formative assessment focused on learning and improvement, known to benefit lower status students. Normative assessment is usually perceived as relying on an equity principle, with rewards being allocated based on merit and should thus appear as positively associated with the function of selection. Formative assessment is usually perceived as relying on corrective justice that aims to ensure equality of outcomes by considering students' needs, which makes it less suitable for the function of selection. A questionnaire measuring these constructs was administered to university students. Results showed that believing that education is intended to select the best students positively predicts support for normative assessment, through increased perception of its reliance on equity, and negatively predicts support for formative assessment, through reduced perception of its ability to establish corrective justice. This study suggests that the belief in the function of selection as inherent to educational institutions can contribute to the reproduction of social inequalities by preventing change from assessment practices known to disadvantage lower-status student, namely normative assessment, to more favorable practices, namely formative assessment, and by promoting matching beliefs in justice principles.},

Contemporary scholarship generated across the Anglophone West includes many signs that such a shift has occurred, ushered in by the cultural and ideological suffusion of neoliberalism. I enlist interdisciplinary and international evidence of neoliberalism's influence on constructions of girls' sexuality to argue that in the U.S., girls are now judged on their adherence not only to gendered moralist norms, but also to a neoliberal script of sexual agency. In addition to reviewing conceptual and empirical grounds for this claim, I consider the multidimensional normative field created by the intersection of this Agency Line with the long-standing Virgin-Slut Continuum. The primacy of agency within neoliberal discourse seems to legitimize women's sexual autonomy and its subjective nature may permit them some control over their position above the Agency Line. But upon critical inspection it becomes clear that young women remain confined to a prescribed normative space that divides them from one another, compels self-blame, and predicates their worth on cultural appraisals of their sexuality.},

These discourses are amplified by elite university scholarship programs which aim to foster economic and cultural leaders while adopting a highly exclusive process in selecting their participants. Drawing on ideas of youth geographies and mobilities, we foreground the experiences and aspirations of eight students involved in one such program in a large Australian university to reflect on how they navigate the incitement to become a global actor and the costs or complexities of becoming that actor. We conclude by arguing that more critical understandings need to be brought to the growing geographic mobility of young people in pursuit of, and as a product of, their higher education.},

  abstract = {While some groups of young people may negotiate successful transitions to work, others are unable or unlikely to do so. The concept of `fair exchange' is pertinent to understanding youth transitions in their formative stages through educational experiences. Patterns of disrupted education challenge the education\textendash work nexus not only because failure in education may limit labour market competitiveness but because the perceived false promises of educational exchange, together with the immediate and available rewards of local cultural options, may, from young people's perspectives, necessitate alternative transitions. The ascendancies of risk management constitute the emergence of binary systems of youth governance in which youth are dichotomised as potential citizen-workers or people in need of control and discipline. The hardening of youth justice and the contraction of welfare constrict the legitimate places of youth participation. Yet marginalised youth do not necessarily give up the ideal of a fair exchange, as their continued efforts in school and orientations towards work show. However, the `fair exchange' within the youth justice system is fundamentally different from exchanges within other systems, warranting consideration of how failure in education together with forms of youth governance are implicated in the questionable, on social justice grounds, alternative transitions through youth justice.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality is usually assumed to be a threat to social cohesion and democracy. Nevertheless, this opposition of inequality and democracy is based on further assumptions such as (a) that people perceive economic inequality accurately, and (b) that, by and large they consider inequality unjust. Research into distributive issues has not found consistent support for neither of these assumptions. Quite the contrary, empirical evidence indicates that economic inequality is widely misperceived and that inequality is to some extent considered legitimate. So far most of the empirical evidence in the area of legitimacy comes from experimental studies in the developed world. The present research aims at widening the scope of legitimacy studies by focusing on Chile as a case country, one of the societies with the highest economic inequality worldwide, guided by the question to what extent is economic inequality considered legitimate in a context of high economic inequality? In addressing this question, and based on previous evidence, the article proposes a way to evaluate (a) the legitimacy of inequality at a country level via survey research, and (b) the role of inequality perception and justice ideologies in the justification of economic inequality. The data to be analyzed is the public opinion survey International Social Justice Project (ISJP), implemented in Chile in the year 2007 (n~=~890). Multivariate analysis results reveal signs of legitimacy of inequality in Chile, opening a series of issues regarding the acceptance and stability of unequal distributions.},

La presente investigaci\'on propone un marco conceptual y emp\'irico para el estudio de las percepciones y preferencias meritocr\'aticas que, posteriormente, es relacionado con una serie de variables relativas a la desigualdad social. Utilizando datos de la encuesta chilena ``Justicia social y participaci\'on ciudadana'' (N= 1.245), los resultados del an\'alisis sugieren que las preferencias y percepciones de la meritocracia son constructos distintos y que quienes perciben un adecuado funcionamiento de la meritocracia tambi\'en perciben menos desigualdad social.},

  abstract = {In this article, we return to Max Weber's distinction between class and status as related but different forms of social stratification. We argue that this distinction is not only conceptually cogent, but empirically important as well. Indeed, class and status do have distinct explanatory power when it comes to studying varying areas of social life. Consistent with Weber's assertions, we show that economic security and prospects are stratified more by class than by status, while the opposite is true for outcomes in the domain of cultural consumption. Within politics, class rather than status predicts Conservative versus Labour Party voting in British general elections and also Left-Right political attitudes. But it is status rather than class that predicts Libertarian-Authoritarian attitudes.},

  abstract = {As in other advanced industrial democracies, tax and welfare policies in Australia over the last few decades have tended to preserve benefits for some groups of citizens while the safety net for others is weakened. Young people, including children, are among those bearing increased social risks which tend to be exacerbated rather than ameliorated by redistributive policies. There is little evidence of discontent about the overall redistributive policy context, suggesting it broadly aligns with public opinion. The research described in this paper set out to explore the factors underpinning the attitudes of young adult and senior Australians towards redistributive policy, whether there were differences between the two age groups, and if there was any support for policy reform. The results suggest that the young participants' habituation to neo-liberal policy settings, particularly their adherence to individualistic norms, made them less likely than the seniors to express negative attitudes towards existing policy settings or to advocate reform.},

Men and women both help others frequently, but assistance often follows traditional gender role expectations, which further reinforces restrictive gender stereotypes in other domains. We propose an integrative process model of gender roles inhibiting prosociality (GRIP) to explain why and how this occurs. We argue that prosociality provides a unique entry point for change because it is (a) immediately rewarding (which cultivates positive attitude formation), (b) less likely to threaten the gender status hierarchy, and therefore less susceptible to social backlash (which translates into less restrictive social norms), and (c) a skill that can be learned (which leads to stronger beliefs in one's own ability to help). Using the GRIP model, we derive a series of hypothesized interventions to interrupt the self-reinforcing cycle of gender role stereotyping and facilitate progress toward broader gender equality.},

  abstract = {La confianza pol\'itica proporciona la necesaria legitimidadpara las instituciones pol\'iticas y las acciones que realizan en nombre de los ciudadanos. La confianza pol\'itica es especialmente importante en las democracias no solo para sostener y construir la cohesi\'on social, sino tambi\'en para alentar a los ciudadanos a trabajar juntos por los principios democr\'aticos. En este cap\'itulo nos propusimos investigar el papel de las escuelas y la contribuci\'on que pueden hacer para generar confianza pol\'itica entre los j\'ovenes. Adem\'as, queremos centrarnos en el uso de modelos multinivel como una t\'ecnica anal\'itica que tiene el potencial de aprovechar los resultados en diferentes niveles de los sistemas educativos. La muestra comprend\'ia 23,654 estudiantes de secundaria b\'asica que hab\'ian participado recientemente en el Estudio Internacional de Educaci\'on C\'ivica y Ciudadan\'ia de 2009 (ICCS2009). Los estudiantes fueron seleccionados de escuelas en cinco sociedades asi\'aticas, a saber, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Corea, Taiw\'an y Tailandia. Las escuelas se eligieron mediante muestreo probabil\'istico proporcional y los estudiantes de las escuelas proven\'ian de una sola clase intacta. La edad media de los estudiantes era de 13,5 a\~nos en el momento de la prueba dentro de cada sociedad. Los resultados muestran que las escuelas pueden desempe\~nar un papel en el desarrollo de la confianza pol\'itica en las cinco sociedades que hemos estudiado. Dentro de las sociedades, las escuelas que utilizan procesos y estructuras generalmente democr\'aticos para los estudiantes tienen m\'as probabilidades de generar confianza pol\'itica que las que no lo hacen. Sin embargo, existe una diferencia sustancial entre sociedades en los mecanismos a trav\'es de los cuales la escuela influye en la confianza pol\'itica de los estudiantes. Adem\'as, se observan matices en las sociedades en cuanto a g\'enero y roles parentales. Los hallazgos reportados en este cap\'itulo han proporcionado informaci\'on importante para futuras investigaciones sobre la socializaci\'on pol\'itica de los adolescentes. \textcopyright{} 2011 por Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

La confianza pol\'itica es especialmente importante en las democracias no solo para sostener y construir la cohesi\'on social, sino tambi\'en para alentar a los ciudadanos a trabajar juntos por los principios democr\'aticos. En este cap\'itulo nos propusimos investigar el papel de las escuelas y la contribuci\'on que pueden hacer para generar confianza pol\'itica entre los j\'ovenes. Adem\'as, queremos centrarnos en el uso de modelos multinivel como una t\'ecnica anal\'itica que tiene el potencial de aprovechar los resultados en diferentes niveles de los sistemas educativos. La muestra comprend\'ia 23,654 estudiantes de secundaria b\'asica que hab\'ian participado recientemente en el Estudio Internacional de Educaci\'on C\'ivica y Ciudadan\'ia de 2009 (ICCS2009). Los estudiantes fueron seleccionados de escuelas en cinco sociedades asi\'aticas, a saber, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Corea, Taiw\'an y Tailandia. Las escuelas se eligieron mediante muestreo probabil\'istico proporcional y los estudiantes de las escuelas proven\'ian de una sola clase intacta. La edad media de los estudiantes era de 13,5 a\~nos en el momento de la prueba dentro de cada sociedad. Los resultados muestran que las escuelas pueden desempe\~nar un papel en el desarrollo de la confianza pol\'itica en las cinco sociedades que hemos estudiado. Dentro de las sociedades, las escuelas que utilizan procesos y estructuras generalmente democr\'aticos para los estudiantes tienen m\'as probabilidades de generar confianza pol\'itica que las que no lo hacen. Sin embargo, existe una diferencia sustancial entre sociedades en los mecanismos a trav\'es de los cuales la escuela influye en la confianza pol\'itica de los estudiantes. Adem\'as, se observan matices en las sociedades en cuanto a g\'enero y roles parentales.

As a consequence, the implementation of interventions that reduce the SES achievement gap in education may face important ideological barriers. The purpose of the present article is to test the belief in school meritocracy as one of these barriers. In three studies, participants' willingness to see an equalizing pedagogical intervention implemented in one's own university (Study 1) or in one's own children's school (Studies 2 and 3) and their intention to engage in this implementation were measured. Results indicated that a higher belief in school meritocracy (but not meritocracy endorsement, Study 1) predicted lower engagement in the implementation of an equalizing method. This is not observed for inequality-maintaining interventions (Studies 2 and 3), sustaining the role of descriptive school meritocracy in the perpetuation of social inequalities within education.},

In three studies, participants' willingness to see an equalizing pedagogical intervention implemented in one's own university (Study 1) or in one's own children's school (Studies 2 and 3) and their intention to engage in this implementation were measured. Results indicated that a higher belief in school meritocracy (but not meritocracy endorsement, Study 1) predicted lower engagement in the implementation of an equalizing method. This is not observed for inequality-maintaining interventions (Studies 2 and 3), sustaining the role of descriptive school meritocracy in the perpetuation of social inequalities within education.},

We found that contact was positively associated with motivation for change, an effect mediated by decreased perceived legitimacy of status differences. Moreover, for the advantaged group, membership salience moderated the effects of quality (but not quantity) of contact. Indirect effects were instead not moderated by content of contact (an index considering the extent to which contact was characterized by a focus on differences vs. commonalities between groups).

Specifically, we tested sociostructural variables (status legitimacy and stability, and permeability of group boundaries) as potential mediators of contact in a sample of both advantaged (Italian high school students, N = 392) and disadvantaged (immigrant high school students, N = 165) group members. We found that contact was positively associated with motivation for change, an effect mediated by decreased perceived legitimacy of status differences. Moreover, for the advantaged group, membership salience moderated the effects of quality (but not quantity) of contact. Indirect effects were instead not moderated by content of contact (an index considering the extent to which contact was characterized by a focus on differences vs. commonalities between groups). Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {In a cross-sectional questionnaire study with N\,=\,1045 German students between 13 and 18~years old (M\,=\,14.1, SD\,=\,0.6), we investigated the relation between students' cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization and their personal belief in a just world (BJW). We considered students' individual experience of teacher and classmate justice as possible mediators of these relations, and statistically controlled for student sex, internet use, empathy, and social desirability. Bootstrap mediation analyses showed that the more students endorsed personal BJW, the more they evaluated their teachers' and classmates' behavior toward them personally as just, and the less likely they were to report that they cyber-bullied others or were victims of cyber-bullying. The students' individual experiences of teacher justice mediated the association between personal BJW and cyber-bullying perpetration, whereas their experience of classmate justice mediated the relation between personal BJW and cyber-bullying victimization. The pattern of results persisted when we controlled for student sex, average internet use per day, empathy, and social desirability. We discuss the adaptive functions of BJW and implications for future school research and practice.},

I begin by describing different ways of measuring perceptions of inequality, and conclude that absolute measures\textemdash which ask respondents to estimate inequality in more concrete terms\textemdash tend to be more useful and accurate than relative measures.  I then describe how people understand inequality, highlighting the roles of cognitive heuristics, accessibility of information, self-interest, and context and culture.  I review the evidence regarding how people react to inequality, suggesting that inequality is associated with higher well-being in developing nations but lower well-being in developed nations, mostly because of hopes or fears for the future.  The evidence from developed nations suggests that inequality increases individuals' concerns about status and economic resources, increases their perception that the social world is competitive and individualistic, and erodes their faith in others, political systems, and democracy in general.},

Drawing on previous definitions and operationalisations, a new typology for political participation and civic engagement is developed, highlighting the multidimensionality of both concepts. In particular, it makes a clear distinction between manifest ``political participation'' (including formal political behaviour as well as protest or extra-parliamentary political action) and less direct or ``latent'' forms of participation, conceptualized here as ``civic engagement'' and ``social involvement''. The article argues that the notion of ``latent'' forms of participation is crucial to understand new forms of political behaviour and the prospects for political participation in different countries. Due to these innovations it contributes to a much-needed theoretical development within the literature on political participation and citizen engagement.},

  abstract = {Many people believe in equality of opportunity but overlook and minimize the structural factors that shape social inequalities in the United States and around the world, such as systematic exclusion (e.g., educational, occupational) based on group membership (e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic status). As a result, social inequalities persist and place marginalized social groups at elevated risk for negative emotional, learning, and health outcomes. Where do the beliefs and behaviors that underlie social inequalities originate? Recent evidence from developmental science indicates that an awareness of social inequalities begins in childhood and that children seek to explain the underlying causes of the disparities that they observe and experience. Moreover, children and adolescents show early capacities for understanding and rectifying inequalities when regulating access to resources in peer contexts. Drawing on a social reasoning developmental framework, we synthesize what is currently known about children's and adolescents' awareness, beliefs, and behavior concerning social inequalities and highlight promising avenues by which developmental science can help reduce harmful assumptions and foster a more just society.},

  abstract = {Children aged 7 to 12 and drawn from contrasting social backgrounds made estimates of the incomes of people in different occupations and made judgements about the fairness of income differences. Middle-class children, as compared to working-class children, not only made higher overall estimates of income for all the occupations considered but also perceived a greater spread in incomes and a clearer division between manual and non-manual occupations. Irrespective of their own social class background, a majority of children regarded differences in income as justified on grounds of equity. However, the middle-class children appeared to possess a more extensive rationale for inequality and to be more committed to it. They also seemed more sensitive to other consequences of income differences. The results are discussed in terms of alternative theories of socio-cognitive development.},

Data are from 31 nations and 66,777 individual respondents analyzed using structural equation and multilevel regression methods with multiple imputation of missing data. Results. In poor countries, but not in rich, most believe that family needs legitimate higher pay. Within countries\textemdash particularly English-speaking ones\textemdash low SES groups endorse family needs, but high SES groups reject them. Valuing performance and effort is widespread throughout the world and throughout all segments of society, high and low. Education and authority are widely valued, more in poor nations than in rich, with some demographic differences but few socioeconomic cleavages. Conclusions. There is conflict both within nations and between them as to whether need and education/authority justify unequal pay, but consensus that performance on the job does justify it.},

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between tolerance towards immigrants and support for democracy, repression potential, right-wing authoritarianism, and out-group trust. Results showed that tolerance towards immigrants should be treated as a two-dimensional concept: support for equal rights, focused on equality in labour market, housing or access to education, and support for cultural rights, encompassing acceptance of immigrants' rights to practice their culture and religion. We found that Czech adolescents were generally more supportive of equal rights than of cultural rights, and that out-group trust explained most of the variance for both dimensions of tolerance towards immigrants. The study also indicated ambiguous effects in the relationship between right-wing authoritarianism, repression potential and support for equal/cultural rights of immigrants with out-group trust used as moderating variable.},

In the present cross-sectional study, associations between students' perceptions of school climate dimensions and their level of engagement were explored. The differential effects on these associations of sex and social background were also examined. Results from a sample of 955 high-school students showed that a model incorporating six dimensions of perceived school climate explained a large proportion of the variance in students' engagement, especially affective engagement. The perceived climate of relations between teachers and students appeared to be highly predictive of students' engagement. Analyses also revealed that the predictiveness of school climate factors for affective, cognitive and behavioral engagement varied slightly according to sex and social background.

This article explores the political dimension of this tension, analyzing the role played by organized civil society in protecting citizens` rights. In this article, I argue that three factors are crucial to understand such influence: the access to the political system, the resources for mobilization these groups have, and the level of police corporativeness. Considering the case of Argentina, the article analyzes the impact of the third dimension -police corporativeness- contrasting the cases of the Federal Police in the Buenos Aires Capital District, the Provincial Police in the surrounding area of Buenos Aires, and the case of Carabineros in Chile. The main claim of this article is that organized civil society has an greater impact over agenda setting than over policy implementation even in cases where civil society is strong.

In this paper we assess some of the empirical links between police legitimacy, political ideology (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and support for `reasonable' use of force (e.g. an officer striking a citizen in self-defence) and `excessive' use of force (e.g. an officer using violence to arrest an unarmed person who is not offering violent resistance). Analysing data from an online survey with US participants (n = 186) we find that legitimacy is a positive predictor of reasonable but not excessive police use of force, and that political ideology predicts support for excessive but not reasonable use of force. We conclude with the idea that legitimacy places normative constraints around police power. On the one hand, legitimacy is associated with increased support for the use of force, but only when violence is bounded within certain acceptable limits. On the other hand, excessive use of force seems to require an extra-legal justification that is \textendash{} at least in our analysis \textendash{} partly ideological. Our findings open up a new direction of research in what is currently a rather sparse psychological literature on the ability of legitimacy to `tame' coercive power.},

  abstract = {Under what conditions do people support police use of force? In this paper we assess some of the empirical links between police legitimacy, political ideology (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and support for `reasonable' use of force (e.g. an officer striking a citizen in self-defence) and `excessive' use of force (e.g. an officer using violence to arrest an unarmed person who is not offering violent resistance). Analysing data from an online survey with US participants (n = 186) we find that legitimacy is a positive predictor of reasonable but not excessive police use of force, and that political ideology predicts support for excessive but not reasonable use of force. We conclude with the idea that legitimacy places normative constraints around police power. On the one hand, legitimacy is associated with increased support for the use of force, but only when violence is bounded within certain acceptable limits. On the other hand, excessive use of force seems to require an extra-legal justification that is \textendash{} at least in our analysis \textendash{} partly ideological. Our findings open up a new direction of research in what is currently a rather sparse psychological literature on the ability of legitimacy to `tame' coercive power.},

  abstract = {This article explores the association between intergenerational social mobility and attitudes towards income differences in post-socialist societies. I hypothesise that based on the psychological mechanism of self-serving bias in causal attribution, those who experience upward social mobility are more likely to support greater income differences, and that subjective intergenerational mobility has stronger association with attitudes towards income differences than objective mobility because individuals filter their objective environment in order to derive their subjective perceptions of the world and their own experiences. The described hypotheses are tested with two cross-national data sets \textendash{} European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings are robust to alternative statistical specifications and indicate that individuals who perceive themselves as subjectively mobile have significantly different attitudes towards income differences in comparison to non-mobile groups, but that this effect does not manifest among objectively mobile individuals.},

  abstract = {The Scandinavian public school systems are free of charge and are central institutions upholding the egalitarian ideals that these societies are famous for. However, they do provide some students with privileged resources and enables trajectories that are out of reach for others. In this article, we address how students at two elite high schools in central Oslo acquire knowledge and relate to the `eliteness' of their schools. Through individual interviews with 73 students we arrive at a closer understanding of elite schools and privileged students in the Norwegian school system. The two schools, Oslo Commerce School (OCS) and Schola Osloensis (SO), share elite characteristics, but have strikingly different school cultures. Their elite identification is examined through looking at their attitude towards learning, school work and elite status. The study unfolds how the `ease' often associated with elite education is not necessarily developed, and is acquired in different ways. This glimpse into Norwegian elite schooling offers a challenge to the generalizability of studies from more market-oriented school systems.},

The authors view political development from the perspective of a general theory of socialization, and compare the influences of social class, intelligence, teacher attitude, and religious membershipon the growth of political attitudes. The book outlines the way in which the child\&\#39;s political awareness evolvesfrom identification with authority figures such as father, policeman, the president, to a grasp of more abstract political concepts and the rudiments of political participation. Illuminating a topic of great theoretical concern and practical educational importance, the book is a significant contribution to the fields of political sociology, child development and educational psychology, and an important reference work for all concerned with the processes of socialization and of attitude formation in general. The Development of Political Attitudes in Children was based on a major survey, the first of its kind, begun at the University of Chicago in 1960 to ascertain information about the induction of children into the political life of the United States, to describe the nature of socialization into citizenship roles, and to examine pre-adult political learning and behavior in terms of other implications for the stability of the political system.

  abstract = {This study examines the subjective understandings of advantage and disadvantage of Oslo youth. It combines survey and interview material where participants have been invited to judge the relevance of various assets for and obstacles to achieving one's goals in life. As advantages and disadvantages can be grouped into factors within and outside the control of individuals, this object of study is of direct relevance to the long-standing debate about individualization, class, and youth subjectivity. The study finds a widespread adherence among participants to the central tenets of individualism, but this endorsement is not accompanied by a rejection of the impact of family resources. The study further identifies social differences in that youth from higher class backgrounds are more inclined to acknowledge assets and obstacles of a structural quality. Finally, participants from dissimilar class backgrounds mobilize structural factors in reflexive, but dissimilar ways.},

The findings show that although levels of support for gender equality in the realms of the family and the market are positively associated with fertility rates, an even stronger relationship to fertility emerges when weighing the differences between the levels of support for gender equality in each realm. The findings lend some corroboration to McDonald's hypothesis, which suggests that declining fertility rates are influenced by contradictory expectations between gender equality for women in the home and market.},

While some authors assume a direct socialisation effect of educational experience, others have argued that education should be seen as a mere proxy variable for socio-economic status and pre-adult socialisation experiences. In this article we use a 5-year Belgian panel study that tracked respondents between the ages of 16 and 21. Using a hierarchical linear model of repeated measurements, we are able to demonstrate that differences with regard to political trust between future students and non-students are already present and stable at the age of sixteen. Significant determinants were school track and educational goal. The inclusion of actual educational status in the model (at age 21), however, rendered the relation with educational goal not significant. The results suggest that during secondary education students already anticipate and acquire a value pattern that is congruent with their future status. Ultimately, however, this effect is dependent on whether they actually enrol in higher education or not.},

Investigaciones recientes han estudiado las implicaciones del argumento de Russell Dalton de que las normas de ciudadan\'ia basadas en el deber (enfatizando el voto y la obediencia a la ley) est\'an siendo reemplazadas por normas de ciudadan\'ia comprometida (enfatizando formas de participaci\'on autoexpresivas y no institucionalizadas). En este art\'iculo usamos la Encuesta Internacional de Educaci\'on C\'ivica y Ciudadana de 2009 (n = 140,650) para determinar la validez emp\'irica transnacional de las normas comprometidas y basadas en el deber. Por medio del an\'alisis de clases latentes, mostramos que ambas normas de ciudadan\'ia son efectivamente adheridas por diferentes grupos de adolescentes. Sin embargo, tambi\'en mostramos que solo la mitad de la poblaci\'on de investigaci\'on mantiene estas dos normas, mientras que tambi\'en se identifican otras normas m\'as tradicionales.pol\'itico confiarEs m\'as probable que se adhieran a normas comprometidas, pero los hallazgos a nivel de pa\'is contradicen las expectativas: las normas comprometidas son menos frecuentes en las democracias estables altamente desarrolladas, y esto arroja dudas sobre la hip\'otesis de que las nuevas normas de ciudadan\'ia comprometida se encuentran predominantemente en democracias estables altamente desarrolladas. \textcopyright{} 2014, \textcopyright{} El autor (es) 2014.},

  abstract = {Using Singapore as a case study, this paper examines how the discourses of democratic elitism and meritocracy help allocate different citizen roles to students and define the nature of the social studies citizenship education programmes for different educational tracks. While the Singapore education system is not unique in its stratification of students into distinct educational tracks with diverse educational outcomes, it is one of the very few countries with explicitly differentiated formal national citizenship curricula for students from different educational tracks. Students are formally allocated different citizenship roles and responsibilities according to the hierarchy defined by the state. Three distinct roles can be identified: (1) elite cosmopolitan leaders; (2) globally-oriented but locally-rooted mid-level executives and workers; and (3) local 'heartlander' followers. To cater to these different citizen roles, the three programmes encompass significantly different curricular goals, content, modes of assessment, civic skills, and values. The findings indicate that only the elite students have access to citizenship education that promotes democratic enlightenment and political engagement. The social studies curriculum for students in the vocational track, in contrast, focuses almost exclusively on imparting a pre-determined body of knowledge and set of values deemed necessary for academically low-achieving students.},

  abstract = {The paper presents an analysis of young people's orientations, and expectations for the future, as they relate to family context and socio-economic background. It draws on data from both the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England and from `Young Lives and Times', part of the ESRC National Centre for Research Methods. The latter study has generated both quantitative and qualitative data, and these are brought together directly in developing the arguments in the paper. The paper explores young people's perceptions of family life, and offers new evidence and analysis of the value they place on emotional support. Attitudinal data show that such support is seen as very important to future success alongside more individualistic, meritocratic, criteria. The paper then explores family contexts and youngsters' orientations to schoolwork, and their expectations for their future education. In respect of the latter, socio-economic background becomes key as a predictor of difference. Through strategically linking qualitative and quantitative data, the paper develops an analysis of individuals' orientations and expectations as these relate to proximate circumstances. Linking quantitative and qualitative evidence in this way helps provide insights into diverse subjectivities, and how they articulate with diverse, class-varying, normal expectations.},

  abstract = {El presente estudio investiga los determinantes de las actitudes de los estudiantes nativos hacia la igualdad de derechos de los inmigrantes, prestando especial atenci\'on al efecto de la participaci\'on de los inmigrantes en el aula y la medida en que puede ser generalizada en los contextos de los pa\'ises. La contribuci\'on arroja una nueva luz sobre la validez de la hip\'otesis del contacto, que sugiere que la mezcla de los nativos y los estudiantes inmigrantes en las escuelas y aulas pueden contribuir a mayores niveles de apoyo a los derechos de los inmigrantes. Los an\'alisis se realizaron en los 18 pa\'ises que participaron en el estudio de ICCS en 2009. En los an\'alisis aplicamos un modelo multinivel de tres niveles controlando para el individuo, caracter\'isticas del aula, y del pa\'is. Probamos una pendiente aleatoria para de los inmigrantes en el aula a nivel nacional, y modelamos ambos efectos lineales y cuadr\'aticos de la cuota de los inmigrantes. El patr\'on general sugiere que en la mayor\'ia de los pa\'ises hay un peque\~no efecto positivo de la inmigraci\'on que no cambia dram\'aticamente en direcci\'on o tama\~no seg\'un mayores niveles de participaci\'on de los inmigrantes.},

It predicts precisely and unambiguously the kind of injustice (i.e., underreward or overreward) and the degree of injustice associated with given departures from perfect justice. The new justice evaluation function was inducted from extensive analyses of survey data on the perceived justice or injustice of earnings. It is directly generalizable to cover all socially distributed goods, and hence I propose it as a candidate for a universal Law of Justice Evaluation in distributional matters. Finally, I suggest that such a Law of Justice Evaluation performs one of the three tasks essential to a scientific theory of distributive justice.},

The theory describes how choices made by individuals (about which goods to value, which social aggregates to form, and what conditions to regard as just or fair for themselves) combine with two objective structural features--the actual distributions of goods and their intercorrelations--to produce the sentiment of justice in the individual. The theory views social relations as a meeting of justice sentiments. Hence, a social aggregate is characterized by the distribution of justice sentiments experienced by its members; and the social aggregate's characteristic social facts are approximated by the parameters of the distribution of justice sentiments, such parameters as the proportion who feel unjustly underrewarded, the Gini's mean difference, the lower extreme value, the overall mean, and many others. By holding constant both the goods of value to the members of a social aggregate and the condition regarded by them as just or fair, it becomes possible to generate expected distributions of justice sentiments from knowledge of the actual distributions of goods, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the theory. In this paper, using three hypothetical distributions of goods (Rectangular, Pareto, and Lognormal), we generate the corresponding expected justice distributions--one negatively skewed Exponential, a family of positively skewed Exponentials, and a family of Normals--and evaluate many parameters of interest.},

We refer this insight to the social reproduction of social inequality: Is socialization of personality characteristics in the parental home a significant mechanism that contributes to a child's life chances? Using school grades as the outcome measure, we combine different pathways toward their achievement: the impact of a child's conscientiousness on school grades, parental conscientiousness and parental stratification as sources for the differential conscientiousness of children, and the mediation of this interrelationship through different parenting styles. To date, almost no research has been conducted which integrates the unequal formation of personality and its consequences regarding life chances and compares it with the respective influences of social origin.

  abstract = {Among a child's skills and competencies, conscientiousness has been shown to be one of the most important predictors of school performance and later academic achievement. We refer this insight to the social reproduction of social inequality: Is socialization of personality characteristics in the parental home a significant mechanism that contributes to a child's life chances? Using school grades as the outcome measure, we combine different pathways toward their achievement: the impact of a child's conscientiousness on school grades, parental conscientiousness and parental stratification as sources for the differential conscientiousness of children, and the mediation of this interrelationship through different parenting styles. To date, almost no research has been conducted which integrates the unequal formation of personality and its consequences regarding life chances and compares it with the respective influences of social origin. Moreover, we add to existing research in social reproduction the distinction between different facets of conscientiousness. We show that it allows for more precise predictions of academic achievement than looking at the highly aggregated Big Five personality traits; moreover, these facets can be much better linked to the established body of sociological stratification theory.

  abstract = {Previous research in industrialized countries finds that attitudes toward gender equality are affected by family-related transitions as young adults with egalitarian attitudes based on growing equality between the sexes in the public sphere of education and work encounter a much less equal situation in the private sphere of the family. Sweden, however, is a society known for its emphasis on gender equality in the family. This study examines the effect of family transitions on attitudes toward gender equality, asking whether egalitarian attitudes can withstand changing family transitions in Sweden. Using longitudinal data from the Young Adult Panel Study, we examine six different family transitions and three measures of attitudes toward gender equality for men and women, with only three significant findings across 18 coefficients. We conclude that most Swedish young adults possess ``enduring attitudes,'' likely because there is strong state support for families and gender sharing in the private sphere.},

Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, this study examines the link between RD and adolescent depression and is the first to test the mechanisms that underlie this relationship. This study finds that controlling for school fixed effects, family income, and observed characteristics of students and their families, students with higher RD within schools exhibit more depressive symptoms. This study also considers how RD may influence adolescent depression. Sobel-Goodman mediation tests reveal that a combination of lowered self-esteem and future expectations (especially about educational attainment) explains nearly half of the association between RD and adolescent depression. Results of this study suggest that social inequality and stratification may implicate population health in the next generation through socioeconomic stratification within schools.},

Policy makers maintain that disadvantaged areas are associated with low aspirations and there is support for this position from academic work on neighbourhood effects and local labour markets, but evidence is slim. Using a two-stage survey of young people in disadvantaged settings in three British cities, the paper provides new data on the nature of young peoples' aspirations, how they change during the teenage years, and how they relate to the places where they are growing up. The findings are that aspirations are very high and, overall, they do not appear to be depressed in relation to the jobs available in the labour market either by the neighbourhood context or by young people's perceptions of local labour markets. However, there are significant differences between the pattern of aspirations and how they change over time in the three locations. The paper then challenges assumptions in policy and in the literature that disadvantaged places equal low aspirations and suggests that understanding how aspirations are formed requires needs a nuanced approach to the nexus of class, ethnicity and institutional influences within local areas.},

His analysis leads him to the thesis that, in view of the shortage in family resources, a combination of factors was required: in addition to economic and school-structural preconditions there had to be the family's support, the offers provided by the school-also in the extracurricular field-as well as the youth movement, which, in combination with the school, provided a space for socialization and for the adoption of a habitus characteristic of the educated classes.},

The data used in this study comes from the International Citizenship and Civic Education (ICCS) survey of 8th-grade student carried out in 2009.

The findings through a nationwide survey of U.S. adults indicate that localized social media use resulted in the increase of interpersonal trust. Furthermore, the results show that trust in community organizations and local political trust played a more important role as a mediator between localized social media use and civic participation.

  abstract = {The parents (58 fathers and 70 mothers) of 104 10th graders completed the Block Child-Rearing Practices Report and a brief parental survey questionnaire; the adolescents were administered the Defining Issues Test. It was found that higher self-image disparity, more positive ideal self-image, and less positive real self-image were related to a higher level of moral judgment. Parental practices that emphasized unilateral respect or that were nonnurturant were related to a lower level of moral judgment and to less emphasis on postconventional judgments. Among boys, higher self-image disparity was related to authoritarian child-rearing practices. Among girls, a more positive ideal self-image was related to father's emphasis on control and supervision and the mother's emphasis on control of sex and aggression. Findings are discussed in terms of sex-role stereotyping, cognitive-developmental factors of self-image, and the importance of opportunities for autonomous functioning in the elaboration of moral judgment.

Little attention, however, is given to how in practice and through the workings of policy, meritocracy functions as an ideology that is struggled over by various social groups and pedagogic agents. Focusing on classroom pedagogic practices in Singapore, this article explores the ways in which in an ostensibly meritocratic education system, teachers interpret and negotiate ideas about culture to engage their students in the system's low-progress tracks. We argue that these teachers are creatively resisting, even challenging official discourses of meritocracy and engaging in what Nancy Fraser calls struggles over recognition and redistribution.},

  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-48442-2},
  abstract = {This open access volume identifies the common and specific aspects of social mechanisms that generate inequalities, through comparative analyses of different dimensions in which inequalities are expressed. It includes studies on social inequalities in 5 European and 5 Latin American countries, along 11 thematic axes: inequalities in the labour market and labour trajectories; asymmetries in the relationship between training and employment; inequalities in work and family life; educational inequalities; geographical and social inequalities: ethnicity and language; social inequalities, migration and space; uncertainty, strategies, resources and capabilities; inequality of opportunity: intergenerational social mobility; social policies; gender inequalities; and research methodology. This volume is the result of a large collaborative project on social inequality funded by the European Commission: the International Network for Comparative Analysis of Social Inequalities. Taking into account diverse perspectives and approximations, the collaborators have created a general analytical framework as a model of analysis of social inequalities. The various contributions in this volume help readers gain a global outlook and help reflect on social inequalities in a comparative perspective. This volume addresses social science graduate and postgraduate students, researchers, social policy makers, as well as a broader academic audience interested in social inequality.},

Family background variables in these categories have small yet theoretically and statistically significant effects on midlife social autonomy. Parental education and occupation are associated with midlife social autonomy among both men and women. Early-life household composition variables and parental income are associated with social autonomy only among women. Adult status variables generally do not mediate the effects of of the family background variables on midlife social autonomy. This suggests that the long-term effects of family background on social autonomy are primarily due to early life socialization.

Methods Participants were asked to read one of four scenarios concerning a generic student asking for the possibility to retake a test she/he had previously failed, with an experimental design including two levels of teacher justice \texttimes{} 2 levels of academic achievement. Then, they answered two items regarding the likelihood of protest on the part of the student depicted in the scenario and enforced by themselves in having to deal with a similar situation. Results The multilevel analysis indicated a principal effect of justice and target, with resistant agency rated as more likely in the unjust condition and for the Other. The justice effect was further qualified by an interaction with the achievement level, with resistant agency higher in the unjust and low achievement condition. Finally, a three-way interaction appeared, with Self resistant agency higher in the just and high achievement condition. Conclusions These results are discussed in terms of their implications for teacher practices, as they emphasize the importance just learning environments have in allowing students to express their opinions as well as dissent.},

  abstract = {Background Notwithstanding the emphasis on the idea that students should be actively and accountably engaged in their educational pathways, little research has investigated learners' agentic behaviours that take the form of student resistance to adult authority. Aims This paper presents an experimental study aimed to assess whether, and to what extent, student Self and Other resistant agency depends on perceptions of teacher justice and student achievement. Methods Participants were asked to read one of four scenarios concerning a generic student asking for the possibility to retake a test she/he had previously failed, with an experimental design including two levels of teacher justice \texttimes{} 2 levels of academic achievement. Then, they answered two items regarding the likelihood of protest on the part of the student depicted in the scenario and enforced by themselves in having to deal with a similar situation. Results The multilevel analysis indicated a principal effect of justice and target, with resistant agency rated as more likely in the unjust condition and for the Other. The justice effect was further qualified by an interaction with the achievement level, with resistant agency higher in the unjust and low achievement condition. Finally, a three-way interaction appeared, with Self resistant agency higher in the just and high achievement condition. Conclusions These results are discussed in terms of their implications for teacher practices, as they emphasize the importance just learning environments have in allowing students to express their opinions as well as dissent.},

  abstract = {In western democracies, schools are expected to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of democratic citizenship. Through citizenship education, schools aim to stimulate the development of civic knowledge, skills and attitudes. This dissertation aims to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the different ways in which citizenship education can effectively stimulate civic engagement in adolescence. The dissertation consists of two parts. The first part focusses on discussions in the classroom on political and social issues. In the second part, I investigate how different types of citizenship education relate to the development of democratic attitudes and political participation. This dissertation uses the data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009 and 2016, a high quality and large-scale dataset consisting of representative samples of 14-year-old students. I apply multilevel regression analyses and (multilevel) structural equation modeling using cross-national data or case studies. In the first part of this dissertation, the focus is on classroom discussions on political and social issues, also referred to as 'open classroom climate'. The research question for this first part of the dissertation is: what determines students' perceptions of an open classroom climate? The main results of the analyses, using data of 22 European countries, is that a school context of mutual respect and responsiveness is important for student perceptions of the classroom climate. When students feel equally and respectfully treated by their teachers, they are more likely to perceive their classroom climate as open. Similarly, when the school is responsive towards student demands, the classroom climate is perceived as more open. When policy and schools want to stimulate classroom discussions, they should not overlook the importance of mutual respect and responsiveness. The importance of the school context was also investigated in relation to political tolerance in a Belgian (Flemish) context. The findings show that when classroom discussions are taken into account as a single predictor, the impression is given that political discourse positively affects political tolerance. However, when a respectful and responsive school context is taken into account, the direct relationship between discussions and tolerance disappears. This means that in a Belgian (Flemish) context, respectful treatment by teachers, and responsiveness of the school towards student demands are more important for political tolerance than the discussions themselves. The second part of this dissertation is dedicated to the overall influence of citizenship education on civic engagement. The research question is as follows: how do different types of citizenship education relate to the development of democratic attitudes and political participation? Three types of citizenship education are investigated: civic learning opportunities, open classroom climate and student participation in school policies. The most important finding is that each type of citizenship education contributes in its own way to students' civic engagement. Consequently, the strength of citizenship education lies in a combination of approaches. Looking at the Belgian (Flemish) data, student participation in school policies is the strongest predictor for non-institutionalized participation. For institutionalized participation, civic learning opportunities seem to matter most. In addition, citizenship education is related to political participation in two ways: in a direct way, as more citizenship education is associated with higher levels of political participation, and in an indirect way, as citizenship education is positively associated with political interest and political efficacy, and such political attitudes are in turn positively related to both types of political participation. When investigating online political participation in 21 countries from different continents, the results indicate that all three types of citizenship education are positively related to political participation, but student participation in school policies seems the most effective. Interestingly, adolescents with a migration background and students with less civic knowledge are more politically active online, whereas they are often participate less frequently in traditional modes of participation. Regarding the effect of citizenship education on political attitudes, the findings indicate that civic learning opportunities are particularly useful for stimulating political interest, whereas student participation at school and classroom discussions seem very effective to stimulate political efficacy. The influence of citizenship education on political trust is rather limited. Only civic learning opportunities have a positive effect on trust in political institutions. However, based on procedural fairness theory, findings show that fair treatment by teachers is strongly related to political trust. When investigating the underlying mechanism, the results indicate that being fairly treated by teachers is positively associated with trust in schools, which is in turn associated with higher levels of political trust. To conclude, the results of this dissertation indicate that schools are able to influence students' civic engagement, but the strength of citizenship education lies in the combination of approaches. Each type contributes to civic engagement in a distinct way. In addition, the importance of the school context should not be overlooked. Feeling fairly and respectfully treated by teachers is positively associated with political trust, as well as with student perceptions of the openness of the classroom climate.},

Regarding the effect of citizenship education on political attitudes, the findings indicate that civic learning opportunities are particularly useful for stimulating political interest, whereas student participation at school and classroom discussions seem very effective to stimulate political efficacy. The influence of citizenship education on political trust is rather limited. Only civic learning opportunities have a positive effect on trust in political institutions. However, based on procedural fairness theory, findings show that fair treatment by teachers is strongly related to political trust. When investigating the underlying mechanism, the results indicate that being fairly treated by teachers is positively associated with trust in schools, which is in turn associated with higher levels of political trust. To conclude, the results of this dissertation indicate that schools are able to influence students' civic engagement, but the strength of citizenship education lies in the combination of approaches. Each type contributes to civic engagement in a distinct way. In addition, the importance of the school context should not be overlooked.

  abstract = {In western democracies, schools are expected to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of democratic citizenship. Through citizenship education, schools aim to stimulate the development of civic knowledge, skills and attitudes. This dissertation aims to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the different ways in which citizenship education can effectively stimulate civic engagement in adolescence. The dissertation consists of two parts. The first part focusses on discussions in the classroom on political and social issues. In the second part, I investigate how different types of citizenship education relate to the development of democratic attitudes and political participation. This dissertation uses the data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009 and 2016, a high quality and large-scale dataset consisting of representative samples of 14-year-old students. I apply multilevel regression analyses and (multilevel) structural equation modeling using cross-national data or case studies. In the first part of this dissertation, the focus is on classroom discussions on political and social issues, also referred to as 'open classroom climate'. The research question for this first part of the dissertation is: what determines students' perceptions of an open classroom climate? The main results of the analyses, using data of 22 European countries, is that a school context of mutual respect and responsiveness is important for student perceptions of the classroom climate. When students feel equally and respectfully treated by their teachers, they are more likely to perceive their classroom climate as open. Similarly, when the school is responsive towards student demands, the classroom climate is perceived as more open. When policy and schools want to stimulate classroom discussions, they should not overlook the importance of mutual respect and responsiveness. The importance of the school context was also investigated in relation to political tolerance in a Belgian (Flemish) context. The findings show that when classroom discussions are taken into account as a single predictor, the impression is given that political discourse positively affects political tolerance. However, when a respectful and responsive school context is taken into account, the direct relationship between discussions and tolerance disappears. This means that in a Belgian (Flemish) context, respectful treatment by teachers, and responsiveness of the school towards student demands are more important for political tolerance than the discussions themselves. The second part of this dissertation is dedicated to the overall influence of citizenship education on civic engagement. The research question is as follows: how do different types of citizenship education relate to the development of democratic attitudes and political participation? Three types of citizenship education are investigated: civic learning opportunities, open classroom climate and student participation in school policies. The most important finding is that each type of citizenship education contributes in its own way to students' civic engagement. Consequently, the strength of citizenship education lies in a combination of approaches. Looking at the Belgian (Flemish) data, student participation in school policies is the strongest predictor for non-institutionalized participation. For institutionalized participation, civic learning opportunities seem to matter most. In addition, citizenship education is related to political participation in two ways: in a direct way, as more citizenship education is associated with higher levels of political participation, and in an indirect way, as citizenship education is positively associated with political interest and political efficacy, and such political attitudes are in turn positively related to both types of political participation.

The purpose of this study is to examine how deliberative democratic theory can be used to explain such perceptions. We argue that the openness of the discussion climate is positively affected by, on the one hand, a context of good student\textendash teacher relations characterised by fairness and respect, and, on the other hand, by the level of collective efficacy, which is the perception of responsiveness of the school towards student demands. Using multilevel analyses on the European data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009), we find that these predictors are significant at the student level and the school level. This means that both the individual experience of a student as well as the average school's score on good student\textendash teacher relations and collective efficacy affect how students perceive the discussion climate. Our findings, based on high-quality survey data from 22 countries, are a significant contribution to clarifying the underlying mechanism leading to an open classroom climate. As such discussions have proven to be an effective way to stimulate political engagement, we conclude that a school context characterised by fairness and responsiveness, should not be overlooked by schools and policy.},

This study examines whether political efficacy and political interest are mediators of expected political participation, using the data of the Belgian (Flemish) sample of the ICCS 2016 study. The results indicate that three educational strategies (i.e., classroom discussions, civic learning opportunities, and student participation at school) are positively associated with expected political participation (i.e., institutionalized and noninstitutionalized participation) in a distinct way. A substantial part of this relationship is mediated by political interest and political efficacy. Future research should take this underlying mechanism into account when studying the development of civic engagement amongst adolescents in a school context. The findings of this study call for a broad approach to citizenship education for the development of political attitudes, as well as behavior.},

Regarding the effect of citizenship education on political attitudes, the findings indicate that civic learning opportunities are particularly useful for stimulating political interest, whereas student participation at school and classroom discussions seem very effective to stimulate political efficacy. The influence of citizenship education on political trust is rather limited. Only civic learning opportunities have a positive effect on trust in political institutions. However, based on procedural fairness theory, findings show that fair treatment by teachers is strongly related to political trust. When investigating the underlying mechanism, the results indicate that being fairly treated by teachers is positively associated with trust in schools, which is in turn associated with higher levels of political trust. To conclude, the results of this dissertation indicate that schools are able to influence students' civic engagement, but the strength of citizenship education lies in the combination of approaches. Each type contributes to civic engagement in a distinct way. In addition, the importance of the school context should not be overlooked. Feeling fairly and respectfully treated by teachers is positively associated with political trust, as well as with student perceptions of the openness of the classroom climate.},

  abstract = {Schools are expected to contribute to preparing students for engaged citizenship. Research shows that open classroom discussions on political issues have a positive effect on political attitudes and behaviour. However, a deeper understanding of why students perceive their classrooms as open for discussion is missing. The purpose of this study is to examine how deliberative democratic theory can be used to explain such perceptions. We argue that the openness of the discussion climate is positively affected by, on the one hand, a context of good student\textendash teacher relations characterised by fairness and respect, and, on the other hand, by the level of collective efficacy, which is the perception of responsiveness of the school towards student demands. Using multilevel analyses on the European data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009), we find that these predictors are significant at the student level and the school level. This means that both the individual experience of a student as well as the average school's score on good student\textendash teacher relations and collective efficacy affect how students perceive the discussion climate. Our findings, based on high-quality survey data from 22 countries, are a significant contribution to clarifying the underlying mechanism leading to an open classroom climate. As such discussions have proven to be an effective way to stimulate political engagement, we conclude that a school context characterised by fairness and responsiveness, should not be overlooked by schools and policy.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality has been on the rise in the United States since the 1980s and by some measures stands at levels not seen since before the Great Depression. Although the strikingly high and rising level of economic inequality in the nation has alarmed scholars, pundits, and elected officials alike, research across the social sciences repeatedly concludes that Americans are largely unconcerned about it. Considerable research has documented, for instance, the important role of psychological processes, such as system justification and American Dream ideology, in engendering Americans' relative insensitivity to economic inequality. The present work offers, and reports experimental tests of, a different perspective\textemdash the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality. Specifically, two convenience samples (study 1, n = 480; and study 2, n = 1,305) and one representative sample (study 3, n = 1,501) of American adults were exposed to information about rising economic inequality in the United States (or control information) and then asked about their beliefs regarding the roles of structural (e.g., being born wealthy) and individual (e.g., hard work) factors in getting ahead in society (i.e., opportunity beliefs). They then responded to policy questions regarding the roles of business and government actors in reducing economic inequality. Rather than revealing insensitivity to rising inequality, the results suggest that rising economic inequality in contemporary society can spark skepticism about the existence of economic opportunity in society that, in turn, may motivate support for policies designed to redress economic inequality.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality has been on the rise in the United States since the 1980s and by some measures stands at levels not seen since before the Great Depression. Although the strikingly high and rising level of economic inequality in the nation has alarmed scholars, pundits, and elected officials alike, research across the social sciences repeatedly concludes that Americans are largely unconcerned about it. Considerable research has documented, for instance, the important role of psychological processes, such as system justification and American Dream ideology, in engendering Americans' relative insensitivity to economic inequality. The present work offers, and reports experimental tests of, a different perspective\textemdash the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality. Specifically, two convenience samples (study 1, n = 480; and study 2, n = 1,305) and one representative sample (study 3, n = 1,501) of American adults were exposed to information about rising economic inequality in the United States (or control information) and then asked about their beliefs regarding the roles of structural (e.g., being born wealthy) and individual (e.g., hard work) factors in getting ahead in society (i.e., opportunity beliefs). They then responded to policy questions regarding the roles of business and government actors in reducing economic inequality. Rather than revealing insensitivity to rising inequality, the results suggest that rising economic inequality in contemporary society can spark skepticism about the existence of economic opportunity in society that, in turn, may motivate support for policies designed to redress economic inequality.},

Political participation is typically characterized by inertia: reproduced within families, highly correlated with social class, and largely stable after the onset of adulthood. This research illustrates an element of political socialization that occurs just before the transition into full citizenship, that mimics adult civic life, and that can be available regardless of family advantage. The authors use two longitudinal national datasets to identify the kinds of voluntary associations that encourage members to be more politically active later in life. They find that general involvement in extracurricular activities is important, but that in particular, involvement in youth voluntary associations concerning community service, representation, speaking in public forums, and generating a communal identity most encourage future political participation. The authors find these effects net of self selection and causal factors traditionally characterized in political socialization research. The influence of youth voluntary associations on future political activity is nontrivial and has implications for both democratic education and election outcomes.},

Method: Utilizing a unique cross-sectional dataset compiled by the Institute for Democracy \& Higher Education for the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections that merges student voting data, enrollment records from the National Student Clearinghouse, and institutional data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, we employed multi-level binary logistic regression to account for individual and organizational influences. Results: The relationship between voting and student characteristics aligns with national voting trends, in that students who are female, older, and White had higher odds of voting. However, there was one notable exception in 2012 where Black students had higher odds of voting than their White peers. We also found that students enrolled full-time and those enrolled at colleges in electoral battleground states were more likely to vote in 2012 and 2016. Weak or mixed relationships emerged between voting and environmental factors such as campaign spending, ballot initiatives, get-out-the-vote programs, restrictive voter laws, and compositional diversity of the student body. Conclusion: This study provides insight for community college leaders on potential ways to engage students in an effort to promote voter turnout in a presidential election year on their campuses. Specifically, we posit that institutions could highlight the salience of public policy issues for students, lobby for less restrictive voting laws, and implement evaluation programs of their civic engagement initiatives.},

Learning about actual levels of inequality and social mobility, research suggests, heightens concerns but may push people's policy preferences in any number of directions. This mixed empirical record, we argue, reflects the omission of a more fundamental question: under what conditions do people change their understanding of the meritocratic or non-meritocratic causes of inequality? To explore mechanisms of belief change we field a unique randomized survey experiment with representative populations in Australia, Indonesia, and Mexico\textemdash societies with varying levels of and popular beliefs about economic inequality. Our results highlight the importance of information, perceived social position, and self-interest. In Indonesia, information describing (high) income inequality and (low) social mobility rocked our participants' belief in meritocracy. The same information made less of a splash in Mexico, where unequal outcomes are commonly understood as the result of corruption and other non-meritocratic processes. In Australia, the impact of our information treatment was strongest when it provided justification for people's income position or when it corrected their perception of relative affluence. Our findings reveal asymmetric beliefs about poverty and wealth and heterogeneous responses to information. They are a call to rethink effective informational and policy interventions.}

  abstract = {Inequality is on the rise: gains have been concentrated with a small elite, while most have seen their fortunes stagnate or fall. Despite what scholars and journalists consider a worrying trend, there is no evidence of growing popular concern about inequality. In fact, research suggests that citizens in unequal societies are less concerned than those in more egalitarian societies. How to make sense of this paradox? I argue that citizens' consent to inequality is explained by their growing conviction that societal success is reflective of a meritocratic process. Drawing on 25-years of International Social Survey Programme data, I show that rising inequality is legitimated by the popular belief that the income gap is meritocratically deserved: the more unequal a society, the more likely its citizens are to explain success in meritocratic terms, and the less important they deem non-meritocratic factors such as a person's family wealth and connections.},

Much less is known, however, about the sources of people's different beliefs. I argue that scholarship is hampered by a lack of consensus regarding the conceptualization and measurement of inequality beliefs, in the absence of an organizing theory. To fill this gap, in this paper, I develop a framework for studying the social basis of people's explanations for inequality. I propose that people observe unequal outcomes and must infer the invisible forces that brought these about, be they meritocratic or structural in nature. In making inferences about the causes of inequality, people draw on lessons from past experience and information about the world, both of which are biased and limited by their background, social networks, and the environments they have been exposed to. Looking at inequality beliefs through this lens allows for an investigation into the kinds of experiences and environments that are particularly salient in shaping people's inferential accounts of inequality. Specifically, I make a case for investigating how socializing institutions such as schools and neighborhoods are ``inferential spaces'' that shape how children and young adults come to learn about their unequal society and their own place in it. I conclude by proposing testable hypotheses and implication for research.},

When comparing groups an assumption is made that the instrument measures the same psychological construct in all groups. If this assumption holds, the comparisons are valid and differences/similarities between groups can be meaningfully interpreted. If this assumption does not hold, comparisons and interpretations are not fully meaningful. The establishment of measurement invariance is a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons across groups. This paper first reviews the importance of equivalence in psychological research, and then the main theoretical and methodological issues regarding measurement invariance within the framework of confirmatory factor analysis. A step-by-step empirical example of measurement invariance testing is provided along with syntax examples for fitting such models in LISREL.},

  abstract = {En las \'ultimas d\'ecadas se ha observado una serie de amenazas a la democracia y su legitimidad. Por un lado, la persistente desigualdad en el acceso a las formas de voz pol\'itica y su v\'inculo estrecho con las condiciones socioecon\'omicas, mientras por otro, una serie de indicios que muestran una creciente desafecci\'on pol\'itica, particularmente de poblaciones juveniles. La preocupaci\'on por el futuro de la democracia ha volcado la mirada hacia las diversas fuentes de socializaci\'on pol\'itica y la formaci\'on de los futuros ciudadanos. Esta tesis doctoral trata acerca de la siguiente pregunta de investigaci\'on: \textquestiondown En qu\'e medida las desigualdades en las fuentes de socializaci\'on se relacionan con las diferentes expresiones de ciudadan\'ia en los j\'ovenes? Espec\'ificamente, \textquestiondown en qu\'e medida las caracter\'isticas socioecon\'omicas de la familia se traducen en actitudes y participaci\'on ciudadana de la siguiente generaci\'on? Aborda, por un lado, la pregunta acerca de \textquestiondown cu\'ales son las principales dimensiones de un concepto amplio de ciudadan\'ia juvenil?, y por otro, en la comprensi\'on sobre \textquestiondown qu\'e mecanismospermiten explicar el proceso de transmisi\'on intergeneracional de la desigualdad pol\'itica?

Respecto de la transmisi\'on intergeneracional de la desigualdad pol\'itica se observa que los recursos socioecon\'omicos ejercen una importante influencia en los diferentes tipos de participaci\'on y en las actitudes hacia la igualdad de derechos, siendo la educaci\'on lograda por lo padres y los libros disponibles en el hogar las formas de estratificaci\'on m\'as relevantes para explicar el comportamiento y las actitudes ciudadanas. La educaci\'on lograda por los padres y las consecuencias que ello implica para sus propias disposiciones democr\'aticas se traspasa a los hijos principalmente en forma de una mayor disposici\'on hacia la participaci\'on formal y mayor apoyo a la igualdad de g\'enero. En contraste, aquellas familias que presentan una mayor orientaci\'on hacia la cultura escolar, que se manifiesta en disponer de m\'as libros en el hogar, tienden a generar en sus hijos mayores disposiciones ciudadanas transversales, es decir, esos hijos est\'an dispuestos a participar m\'as y apoyan m\'as la igualdad de derechos para los diferentes grupos sociales.

  abstract = {En las \'ultimas d\'ecadas se ha observado una serie de amenazas a la democracia y su legitimidad. Por un lado, la persistente desigualdad en el acceso a las formas de voz pol\'itica y su v\'inculo estrecho con las condiciones socioecon\'omicas, mientras por otro, una serie de indicios que muestran una creciente desafecci\'on pol\'itica, particularmente de poblaciones juveniles. La preocupaci\'on por el futuro de la democracia ha volcado la mirada hacia las diversas fuentes de socializaci\'on pol\'itica y la formaci\'on de los futuros ciudadanos. Esta tesis doctoral trata acerca de la siguiente pregunta de investigaci\'on: \textquestiondown En qu\'e medida las desigualdades en las fuentes de socializaci\'on se relacionan con las diferentes expresiones de ciudadan\'ia en los j\'ovenes? Espec\'ificamente, \textquestiondown en qu\'e medida las caracter\'isticas socioecon\'omicas de la familia se traducen en actitudes y participaci\'on ciudadana de la siguiente generaci\'on? Aborda, por un lado, la pregunta acerca de \textquestiondown cu\'ales son las principales dimensiones de un concepto amplio de ciudadan\'ia juvenil?, y por otro, en la comprensi\'on sobre \textquestiondown qu\'e mecanismospermiten explicar el proceso de transmisi\'on intergeneracional de la desigualdad pol\'itica? Se organiza principalmente en torno una introducci\'on general y cuatro art\'iculos que abordan las preguntas de investigaci\'on formuladas. Para abordar dichas preguntas se hizo uso del Estudio Internacional de Educaci\'on C\'ivica y Ciudadana el a\~no 2009 (International Civic and Citizenship Study- ICCS 2009), que consideran estudiantes de 15 a\~nos provenientes de un set de 38 pa\'ises.

Using hierarchical analysis, we assess the power of these arguments in Latin America, a region that manifests considerable variation on our central explanatory variables and thus offers important theoretical leverage. We find men's gender attitudes to be highly contingent on elite cues and susceptible to backlash effects in response to women's economic advancement. Also, where women lack national representation, distrust of government promotes support for female leadership as an alternative to the discredited (male) establishment. The analysis supports existing individual-level explanations of gender attitudes and demonstrates a connection between diffuse democratic values and gender egalitarianism. The findings suggest that recent advances for female politicians in Latin America may be susceptible to reversal, and they illuminate strategies for strengthening women's equality in the region.},

Although literature on young people's civic participation is abundant, the role of the family in influencing this participation is largely absent. Drawing on survey data collected from 976 young people aged 13\textendash 14 in South Wales, we outline the extent and nature of civic participation and how this varies according to relationships with parents and grandparents. Our data show that relationships with mothers and grandparents are particularly important in young people's accounts of their participation, suggesting that family is far more important in developing a propensity for engagement in civil society than is commonly understood.},

Understanding the development of physical activity patterns in childhood is thus an important issue for health promotion. Following socialization theory, this study describes and explains differences in objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in a socially and ethnically mixed sample of 6- to 11-year-old children in Germany. MVPA levels were objectively measured with accelerometers over the course of six consecutive days (Wednesday to Monday). Parents' attitudes and practices as well as the family's socio-economic status (SES) were assessed from the parents via questionnaires. Results indicate that MVPA levels of children vary with gender, but not with age and ethnicity. Moreover, parental SES, parental support for the child's sports activities, parents' own sport activities and the parents' belief in sports' capacities to foster personality development, character building and social integration significantly predict the MVPA level of children. It is concluded that interventions to promote MVPA among children need to take family interactions and lifestyles into account and should address families in socio-economically underprivileged areas.},

Understanding the development of physical activity patterns in childhood is thus an important issue for health promotion. Following socialization theory, this study describes and explains differences in objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in a socially and ethnically mixed sample of 6- to 11-year-old children in Germany. MVPA levels were objectively measured with accelerometers over the course of six consecutive days (Wednesday to Monday). Parents' attitudes and practices as well as the family's socio-economic status (SES) were assessed from the parents via questionnaires. Results indicate that MVPA levels of children vary with gender, but not with age and ethnicity. Moreover, parental SES, parental support for the child's sports activities, parents' own sport activities and the parents' belief in sports' capacities to foster personality development, character building and social integration significantly predict the MVPA level of children.

  abstract = {Introduction: How income inequality associates with poorer mental health remains unclear. Personal relative deprivation (PRD) involves appraising oneself as unfairly disadvantaged relative to similar others and has been associated with poorer mental health and negative cognitive appraisals. As generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with negative cognitive appraisals, PRD may relate to the experience of GAD and its cognitive predictors, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), positive beliefs about worry (PBW), negative beliefs about worry (NBW), and experiential avoidance (EA).             Method: In two observational studies (Study 1, N = 588; Study 2, N = 301) participants completed measures of PRD, cognitive predictors and symptoms of GAD, subjective socioeconomic status (SES), self-efficacy, and self-esteem.             Results: A relationship between PRD and GAD was found across studies, which was simultaneously mediated by IU and NBW. These results remained when controlling for subjective SES but were weakened when controlling for self-concept factors.             Discussion: This research supports the possibility that the experience of deprivation may ``trap'' people in thinking patterns that contribute to anxious symptomology.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing scholarly interest in conceptualising schools beyond their educational functions, as sites and agents of democracy. Yet this interest is often underpinned by a narrow conception of democracy, focusing solely on schools' public and social aspects. To capture the democratic potential of schools more fully, this article suggests adopting a deliberative systems approach, which conceptualises democracy as differentiated yet linked sites of democratic communications and views schools as one such site. Using this approach as a broader framework and drawing on the fieldwork conducted in two Japanese schools, this article identifies the condition under which schools can become a meaningful part of deliberative systems. It reveals that schools contribute to deliberative systems when they serve as a bridge between children's everyday practices and deliberative actions in the public space. In light of the findings, this article suggests conceptualising schools as a `mediating space'.},

Desde los primeros planes elaborados en la d\'ecada de 1990, y en especial a partir del presente siglo, estos instrumentos se han constituido en verdaderos mapas de ruta de los Estados hacia la igualdad de g\'enero y la garant\'ia de los derechos de las mujeres en la regi\'on, adem\'as de representar una muestra de la voluntad pol\'itica para avanzar en esta materia. El an\'alisis de los procesos de elaboraci\'on de estos planes permite visibilizar en qu\'e aspectos puede mejorar su alcance e incidencia, tanto en lo que respecta a la superaci\'on de la discriminaci\'on y subordinaci\'on que afectan a las mujeres como en relaci\'on con la imprescindible transversalidad de la perspectiva de g\'enero en las pol\'iticas p\'ublicas. Los actuales retos de Am\'erica Latina y el Caribe en materia de igualdad de g\'enero son m\'ultiples y complejos y demandan un compromiso sostenido y transversal del Estado con los derechos humanos de las mujeres y su autonom\'ia. La regi\'on cuenta con una Agenda Regional de G\'enero que debe tenerse en cuenta en la discusi\'on de futuros planes de igualdad y que, junto con la Agenda 2030 para el Desarrollo Sostenible, ha de convertirse en un marco de referencia para las propuestas y objetivos que se establezcan. Finalmente, como se se\~nala en este estudio, la vinculaci\'on y la generaci\'on de sinergias entre los planes de igualdad de g\'enero y los instrumentos de planificaci\'on para el desarrollo constituyen un imperativo - no hay desarrollo posible sin igualdad de g\'enero- y una oportunidad que abre el camino a la instalaci\'on y el fortalecimiento de una arquitectura institucional para la igualdad, la democracia y el desarrollo.

In doing so, the paper extends the empirical scope of previous analyses by exploring, on the one hand, the extent to which student political participation varies across wide ranges of both party- and protest-related activities; and, on the other hand, by looking at differences in student and non-student participation across 6 countries - 4 old democracies in Western European (WE) and 2 post-communist democracies in Central-Eastern Europe (CEE). Methodologically, the paper combines a quasi-experimental design based on genetic matching with regression models in order to better isolate the effect of student status on political participation from that of age, gender, and family background. Using original survey data gathered within the framework of the POLPART Project among 6,990 respondents, the results for both WE and CEE suggest that students do not significantly differ from non-students in terms of political participation when they are matched on age, gender, and family background. Additionally, when controlling for other variables commonly associated with political participation, such as political interest, students actually appear to engage in party politics less than their non-student counterparts. This indicates that existing college-effects models focusing on the impact of being a student on socio-political attitudes are, at best, spurious. When matching and formally comparing students in WE and in CEE, CEE students appear to be more engaged than their WE counterparts. This indicates that the "apathetic" and "atomistic" perspective on CEE political engagement might not hold for more recent years, especially when it comes to Romania.},

Se usa la Encuesta a Padres de Familia con Hijos en Escuelas Secundarias en Tijuana, B.C., 2015, con informaci\'on para 2 560 padres con hijos e hijas en escuelas secundarias p\'ublicas. Se estiman cuatro \'indices sobre la igualdad de g\'enero en el rol materno, los roles dom\'esticos y los liderazgos familiares, y se crean modelos de regresi\'on log\'istica. Los hallazgos indican la coexistencia de un gran valor asignado al rol de la maternidad en la vida de las mujeres, as\'i como actitudes moderadamente entusiastas a favor de la igualdad de g\'enero en los roles dom\'esticos, pero menos entusiastas respecto de compartir e intercambiar los liderazgos familiares. El nivel educativo de los padres muestra ser la \'unica variable estad\'isticamente significativa en su asociaci\'on con los cuatro \'indices considerados.},

However, regarding meritocratic beliefs, sociologists often argue that meritocratic narratives legitimize and make sense of societal inequalities as justly deserved. Using the case of China, I tested these competing hypotheses of the relationship between parental meritocratic beliefs and children's educational achievement. Parental beliefs about skills and hard work as predictors of higher grades were used. I analyzed data from the first and second waves of the China Educational Panel Survey. Autoregressive cross-lagged structural models indicated that parental meritocratic beliefs do not affect children's educational performance but, rather, meritocratic beliefs are affected by academic results, suggesting their justificatory role. This pattern is much sharper in rural China, where traditional Chinese culture is preserved. The implications of meritocratic beliefs for a broader discussion of citizens' beliefs about social inequalities and stratification are discussed.},

Answering such questions is fundamental to understanding political life and the workings of liberal democracies. This book presents the results of one of the most extensive surveys ever undertaken on the levels and patterns of political involvement in Britain. It is based on the findings of a sample survey of nearly 1,600 people across England, Scotland and Wales as well as a further 1,600 men and women and nearly 300 leaders in six specially selected and contrasting communities. These people were asked about the extent to which they had taken political action, particularly at a local level, and the authors found higher levels of participation than previous research has revealed. They analyse these findings in terms of age, gender, social class and education and look at the reactions of local leaders to the efforts people make to influence them.},

  abstract = {Background/Context: Students' perceptions of justice, fairness, and order within their schools are arguably key building blocks of socialization to participation within a democratic society. The ideals of justice, fairness, and order within their schools are particularly imperative because the educational system is founded on a belief of democracy and meritocracy. It is also known that students' perceptions of school justice can vary by race, ethnicity, and gender. What remains uncertain is how the fastest growing segment of the United States, students in immigrant families, perceive the school justice, fairness, and order within their school. Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore if straight-line assimilation, segmented assimilation, and immigrant optimism hypotheses explain the relationships between schools, justice, and immigration, as well as the potential role of gender, race, and ethnicity in immigrant youth perceptions of justice, fairness, and order. Participants/Subjects: This study utilizes the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), a nationally representative sample of high school sophomores. Research Design: This study's research design includes statistical analysis of secondary data. Findings/Results: Findings do suggest that the students' perceptions of justice, fairness, and order are indeed moderated by immigrant generation, race, ethnicity, and gender. Conclusions/Recommendations: Educators and educational researchers who are seeking to better understand the schooling experiences of immigrant youth might benefit from questioning assimilation and Americanization as processes that inevitably promote educational progress. Given that immigrant youth are and have historically been marginalized within U.S. schools, it appears that socialization, Americanization, gender, and immigrant generational status are germane to creating democratic education for all students. Attentiveness to democratic school justice, order, and fairness is, therefore, imperative.},

Do individual income and repression each have a~greater effect than economic inequality? Three prominent theories, namely the Conflict, Relative Power, and Resource Theories address the inequality-participation puzzle in the context of democracies.

Class climate was assessed in terms of two second-order dimensions: classroom climate (e.g., willingness to learn) and student climate (e.g., community). Multilevel analyses revealed that the more the students evaluated their teachers' behavior toward them personally to be just, the more positively they evaluated the classroom and student climate. Moreover, students with a strong BJW tended to evaluate their teachers' behavior toward them personally to be more just and the climate of their class to be more positive. Furthermore, the experience of teacher justice partly mediated the BJW's effect on the climate evaluations. Thus, a strong BJW seems to function as a personal resource for students, explaining significant parts of their individual experience of both teacher justice and class climate at school. Most importantly, individually experienced teacher justice seems to be a significant factor when it comes to understanding class climate. Implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is common among youth not in education, employment or training (NEETs). However, the evidence on other adverse childhood experiences as determinants of NEET remains scarce. We use Finnish longitudinal register data on a 20\% random sample of households with 0\textendash 14-year-old children in 2000 to assess the childhood determinants of NEET. For an analytical sample of 99,137 children born 1986\textendash 1993, family socioeconomic resources, parental psychiatric disorders and substance abuse, parental death, living in a single-parent household and out-of-home placement under age 13 were used to predict NEET at the age of 18. We show that family socioeconomic disadvantage is strongly associated with NEET (e.g. odds ratio for parental basic education 5.33, 95\% confidence interval 4.77, 5.95), whereas associations between adverse childhood experiences and NEET are more moderate (e.g. odds ratio for parent hospitalised for psychiatric disorder 1.86, 95\% confidence interval 1.63, 2.12) and largely explained by socioeconomic factors. These associations were mostly similar by gender. The results suggest that parental socioeconomic resources are more important than adverse childhood experiences for the educational and employment transitions of young adults. Thus, supportive social policy for socioeconomically disadvantaged families may smooth these transitions.},

Although YPAR holds particular promise, there has been little systematic assessment of its effects. Moreover, no study has investigated the role of YPAR in the promotion of active citizenship. We report on an effectiveness evaluation of a YPAR project designed to promote European active citizenship (i.e., identification and attitudes toward a political entity, institutional trust, participation, and political alienation) and social well-being among adolescents. Our sample included 69 Italian high school students (35 in the intervention group; 34 in the control group). We evaluated the impact of YPAR using a pretest\textendash posttest control group design and fitting the generalized estimating equations procedure. The results showed that participants in the intervention group reported increased scores on social well-being, institutional trust, and participation and decreased scores on political alienation compared with the control group. We found no significant effects for identification as European and attitudes toward a political entity. Findings support the benefits of YPAR in terms of social well-being and active citizenship.},

Although YPAR holds particular promise, there has been little systematic assessment of its effects. Moreover, no study has investigated the role of YPAR in the promotion of active citizenship. We report on an effectiveness evaluation of a YPAR project designed to promote European active citizenship (i.e., identification and attitudes toward a political entity, institutional trust, participation, and political alienation) and social well-being among adolescents. Our sample included 69 Italian high school students (35 in the intervention group; 34 in the control group). We evaluated the impact of YPAR using a pretest\textendash posttest control group design and fitting the generalized estimating equations procedure. The results showed that participants in the intervention group reported increased scores on social well-being, institutional trust, and participation and decreased scores on political alienation compared with the control group. We found no significant effects for identification as European and attitudes toward a political entity. Findings support the benefits of YPAR in terms of social well-being and active citizenship.},

A total of 210 participants who had visited a public school gave information about their justice experiences in school, general trust, and democratic attitudes. First, it was shown that overall experiences of distributive and interactional justice predict democratic attitudes, more specifically the approval of civic and human rights and the approval of the democratic institutions. Second, we found that the relationships between overall distributive and interactional justice and the approval of civic and human rights, the approval of the democratic institutions, and the approval of democracy-supporting behaviors are each mediated by general trust which can be interpreted as a social exchange process.

A total of 210 participants who had visited a public school gave information about their justice experiences in school, general trust, and democratic attitudes. First, it was shown that overall experiences of distributive and interactional justice predict democratic attitudes, more specifically the approval of civic and human rights and the approval of the democratic institutions. Second, we found that the relationships between overall distributive and interactional justice and the approval of civic and human rights, the approval of the democratic institutions, and the approval of democracy-supporting behaviors are each mediated by general trust which can be interpreted as a social exchange process. This study therefore highlights the role of general justice-related school experiences for the development of democratic attitudes.},

  abstract = {School can be regarded as an important factor in the development of children's values and attitudes. Given this great importance of justice experiences for students' development, this study aimed at examining the influence of perceived injustice in school on students' emotions, well-being, and behavior with an experimental longitudinal design. In total, 196 students participated in this study and came to the university with their classes to receive extra teaching once a week for six consecutive weeks. To manipulate justice perceptions, a scenario of arbitrary privilege was chosen to lead students of the experimental group to experience injustice from a beneficiary perspective. We found that students in the experimental group reported higher well-being and a higher appreciation of the opportunity to learn than the control group did. Additionally, they showed an increase in justice-related negative emotions over time; that is, they expressed more of a bad conscience and stronger feelings of anger the more they became aware of their privilege. This study shows that even subtle experiences of injustice in school can have an impact on students' outcomes. These results are discussed with regard to practical implications.},

This study explores the effect of both mothers' and fathers' political activity on their offspring's intention to participate. Using a data set from 2085 Belgian parent\textendash child triads, we tested the direct and indirect transmission of political participation intention. We found that although there is a direct transmission of political participation intention, after controlling for political discussion, political interest and socio-economic status, this effect is completely mediated. Therefore, we conclude that intergenerational transmission is an indirect process, supported by a high socio-economic status, more political interest and a more politicized family environment in which politics is clearly perceived as salient.},

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 17 middle-class and working-class and poor Mexican American parents, we explore social class patterns in childrearing practices and beliefs. Rather than stark-class differences found in previous work, we observed substantial similarities across social class lines. Our findings suggest that (1) Social mobility experienced by middle-class parents complicate class-based parenting beliefs. (2) Variation in parenting approaches in the same household mitigates class distinctions. (3) Mexican Americans' shared contextual experiences and cultural values minimize social class differences in childrearing. These findings reshape the literature on class differences in parenting and show how social class and race and ethnicity impact childrearing beliefs and practices that are better illuminated when studied as a process.},

Collectively, students considered the distribution of outcomes, the procedures for outcome distributions, the interpersonal relationships, and the communication procedures in conceptualizing fairness. Students also reported positive feelings such as happiness, satisfaction, feeling valued, and hopefulness when describing fair incidents, while they tended to report negative feelings such as anger, upset, disappointment, and embarrassment as responses to unfair incidents. Students also reported increased classroom engagement and greater adaptation in responses to fairness incidents, while they reported class disengagement, inaction, and dissent as responses to unfair incidents.

This is especially the case in democratic societies, which are based on citizens' participation. Hence, education for citizenship is uniformly considered as a major mission of the common school, along with its central task of imparting knowledge. In this paper we add to the abundant empirical work on the contributing factors to and behavioral consequences of civic education, focusing on the role of the students' sense of justice in school. We refine previous approaches by distinguishing among three dimensions of the sense of justice, two pertaining to the distributive, and one to the procedural justice. We investigate the effects of these dimensions on four kinds of civic behavior relevant to school life: academic dishonesty, violence, extracurricular activity in school and community volunteering. The study was carried out among about 5000 Israeli middle school students (8th and 9th grades). Findings suggest that, overall, students who perceive their teachers as just tend to refrain from violence and to engage to a greater extent in extra-curricular school activity and community volunteering.},

We refine previous approaches by distinguishing among three dimensions of the sense of justice, two pertaining to the distributive, and one to the procedural justice. We investigate the effects of these dimensions on four kinds of civic behavior relevant to school life: academic dishonesty, violence, extracurricular activity in school and community volunteering. The study was carried out among about 5000 Israeli middle school students (8th and 9th grades). Findings suggest that, overall, students who perceive their teachers as just tend to refrain from violence and to engage to a greater extent in extra-curricular school activity and community volunteering.},

In light of grades' instrumental, motivational, and symbolic saliency in students' school experience, it is not surprising they are highly ""valued goods," and the process of their fair or unfair distribution is of great concern, echoed in students ' and teachers ' discourses. In this investigation, we focus on gender differentials in sense of justice about grades, comparing high school students in two educational settings: Israel and Germany. Although the strong norm of equitable distribution of grades would predict no gender differentials in grade allocation, the pattern of results suggest that gender plays a role in both the distribution of this reward and the judgment of fair distribution, therefore affecting students' sense of (in)justice. Similarities as well as certain differences in the comparison of sense of justice of Israeli and German boys and girls are discussed in light of system-specific features.},

Assuming that both reward distribution and the evaluation of its fairness occur within, and are affected by, the educational context (schools and classrooms), this investigation focuses on the effect of classroom composition on perceptions of deprivation \textendash{} the gap between the actual reward and the one to which the individual judges himself or herself entitled. The possibility that class composition is a referential structure influencing both actual reward allocation and the determination of entitlement is discussed and investigated empirically in a sample of over 9,000 Israeli junior high students with regard to two academic rewards: grades and ability group placement. The findings suggest that class composition does serve as such a comparison referent and thus affects the perception of deprivation.},

The study was carried out among language, math and science teachers in a national sample of Israeli high schools, where teachers were required to weigh a set of considerations that are used in the decision on grade allocation. Findings suggest that (a) a teacher's decision is based on a weighted combination of multi-principles of allocation, (b) equity by output (students proved academic success) is the ruling consideration, and (c) the weight given to the various considerations differ by teachers' subject matter expertise. The appeared difference placed science teachers vis-\`a-vis math and language teachers, unlike the expected humanities (language)\textemdash sciences (math and science) dichotomy. Comparison of grading considerations by student capacity suggests that about half of the teachers consider differential grading considerations for ``weak'' and ``strong'' students as just, attributing greater weight to academic input (effort) and need for encouragement when grading their ``weak'' students.},

The study was carried out among about 5,000 8th- and 9th-grade students in a national sample of 48 junior high schools in Israel in the 2010\textendash 2011 school year. The two-level data\textemdash individual and school\textemdash were analyzed by the hierarchical linear model (HLM7) program. Findings basically support our hypotheses: sense of distributive instrumental and, especially, of relational justice at school have a positive effect on liberal democratic orientation and on trust in people and in formal institutions. Furthermore, school (aggregate) sense of procedural justice adds to these positive effects and, in the case of democratic orientation, also interacts with instrumental justice and intensifies its effect on this outcome. However, these attitudes are also dependent on sectorial affiliation (Jewish secular, Jewish religious, Israeli\textendash Arab), which explains a considerable portion of between-school variation in student attitudes.},

Overall, the findings portray South Africans as keenly aware of the economic inequality that beleaguers their society, and express a preference for greater distributive fairness. Broad support is also reported in relation to state-led redistribution, though a moderate declining trend is observed over the interval. Race and class differences characterise the survey results, though a majority of better-off South Africans (white, tertiary educated and non-poor citizens) still tend to be inequality averse and voice support for redistribution. Greater polarisation is evident with respect to inequality-related social policy, especially those designed to overcome historical racial disadvantage, though these intergroup differences converge considerably when referring to class-based policy measures. One surprising finding is the evidence that South Africa's youngest generation, known as the `Born Frees', tend to adopt a similar predisposition to redress policy as older generations, thus confounding expectations of a post-apartheid value change. Nonetheless, even though South Africans may not fully agree about the specific elements comprising a socially just response to the country's inequality problem, there does seem to be a stronger basis for a social compact for an inequality reduction agenda than is typically assumed.},

Overall, the findings portray South Africans as keenly aware of the economic inequality that beleaguers their society, and express a preference for greater distributive fairness. Broad support is also reported in relation to state-led redistribution, though a moderate declining trend is observed over the interval. Race and class differences characterise the survey results, though a majority of better-off South Africans (white, tertiary educated and non-poor citizens) still tend to be inequality averse and voice support for redistribution. Greater polarisation is evident with respect to inequality-related social policy, especially those designed to overcome historical racial disadvantage, though these intergroup differences converge considerably when referring to class-based policy measures. One surprising finding is the evidence that South Africa's youngest generation, known as the `Born Frees', tend to adopt a similar predisposition to redress policy as older generations, thus confounding expectations of a post-apartheid value change. Nonetheless, even though South Africans may not fully agree about the specific elements comprising a socially just response to the country's inequality problem, there does seem to be a stronger basis for a social compact for an inequality reduction agenda than is typically assumed.},

Findings revealed that in both Jewish and Druze groups the achievement rules were ranked highest in terms of the actual and ideal ways of determining their grades. These were followed by the personality rules, and lastly by the ascriptive/particularistic rules. Thus, students in these groups share to a large extent their view about the actual and ideal grading practices. At the same time, Jewish students, who live in a market-driven society characterized by individual and competitive relations, ascribe stronger importance to meritocratic rules. In contrast, Druze students, who live in a highly homogeneous environment based on ascriptive status and solidarity relations, have a greater tendency than Jews to think that grading should be guided by particularistic/ascriptive types of rules. A structural analysis of grade distribution rule preferences revealed that they were similarly measured across groups.},

  abstract = {The study by Clara Sabbagh and Hila Malka reported in this chapter examines justice perceptions with respect to different kinds of resources that are distributed to teachers. The authors ask to what extent resource-specific justice perceptions vary across two national groups of teachers (Jewish and Arab) in the Israeli population and educational system. Their findings indicate that Israeli teachers across sectors prefer differentiation (favoring equity over equality/need) and perceive more injustice when universalistic, rather than particularistic resources are at stake. At the same time, justice perceptions were found to vary across sectorial/cultural lines. For instance, Israeli-Arab teachers preferred differentiation of particularistic resources more strongly than their Israeli-Jewish counterparts. Sabbagh and Malka suggest that cross-cultural and cross-sectional research may provide a clearer understanding of patterns of convergence and divergence in the meanings assigned to social resources and of the corresponding distribution rules.},

  abstract = {This article argues that there are distinct spheres of justice within education and examines a range of justice norms and distribution rules that characterize the daily life of schools and classrooms. Moving from the macro to micro level, we identify the following five areas: the right to education, the allocation of (or selection into) learning places, teaching\textendash learning practices, teachers' treatment of students, and student evaluations of grade distribution. We discuss the literature on the beliefs by students and teachers about the just distribution of educational goods in these five domains, and on the practices used in the actual allocation of these goods. In line with normative `spheres of justice' arguments in social theory, we conclude that the ideals of social justice within schools vary strongly according to the particular resource to be distributed. Moreover, these ideals often do not correspond with the practices that actually guide resource distribution in education, which may go some way toward explaining explicit or latent conflicts in this sphere.},

  abstract = {Most conceptual research on equality revolves around theoretical texts or legal theory and decisions, thus reflecting the thought of legal, political, or cultural elites. But in a democratic polity, we must attend to the political thought not just of politicos and academics, but ordinary citizens as well. In terms of its political significance, ``What does equality mean'' requires answering the question: what does equality mean to the mass public? We thus probe the meanings of ``gender equality'' in the public mind, using a unique set of questions included in the National Election Studies 1991 Pilot Study, and con-textualized within the literatures of feminist and legal theory and political psychology and public opinion. Most importantly, we distinguish among ``empirical'' and ``normative'' equality and discontent and among the domains of the polity, economy, and family; feature the problem of ``equality'' versus ``sameness'' and consider the relationship of these orientations to people's own structural circumstances and their other policy and political attitudes. Among the key findings, empirical and normative equality and discontent are functionally different and grounded differently in people's everyday experiences; they distinguish among different domains of life and, especially, between public and private; and there are generational differences in the relationship of ``equality'' to ``sameness.'' We discuss substantive and methodological implications.},

It is also typically informal and dependent on student initiative, requiring that students be skilled at engaging educational authority figures. Privileged students are most likely to have such skills as part of their dominant cultural capital, making faculty mentorship a site of social reproduction. To explore variations in this process, I compare two institution types: a small, teaching/undergraduate-focused regional university and a large, research-intensive flagship. In interviews with 68 working- and upper-middle-class students, I find that college context mediates the relationship of class background and faculty mentorship. Upper-middle-class students fostered advantageous faculty relationships at both universities, but working-class students diverged: at the flagship, they rarely approached professors in search of mentorship, while those at the regional university described close, beneficial connections with professors. I discuss working-class students' dissimilar experiences in terms of each university's structural and cultural characteristics (organizational habitus), particularly their institutional focus and size. I argue that through their particular organizational features, colleges can both reproduce and reduce inequalities, challenging the determinacy of precollege socialization in education.},

What makes citizens trust or distrust their main political institutions? How can we explain the differences found across and within countries? These are the main questions driving this dissertation. The central hypotheses of this study are (1) that we can found differences in levels of political trust both within and across countries, (2) that, at the individual level, political trust is related mainly to perceptions of fairness and competence of national governing institutions, and (3) that, at the country level, political trust is mostly explained by different levels of corruption. In order to evaluate these claims, I analyzed political trust data from the World Values Survey of 50 democracies of the industrialized world, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. To evaluate country differences I used these 50 democracies. To evaluate individual differences and the individual-level correlates of trust, I focused on seven Latin American countries. The results show that, at the country-level, political trust is higher among the most developed democracies and in those countries with longer democratic traditions, parliamentary governments and majoritarian electoral systems. These variables loose relevance and statistical power, however, when the country level of corruption is introduced. Corruption is, according to the results obtained, the major factor in explaining average levels of political trust. At the individual level data, in an analysis of Latin American citizens, we found that the most important factors explaining variations in political trust are those related to the perceptions of fairness and competence of their government institutions. Trust is considerably higher when institutions are considered fair and competent in their actions. Political trust is important for governments. And citizens decide when to grant trust to their political institutions as a response to a multiplicity of factors, of which the level of corruption and the perceptions of institutional fairness and competence are among the most important ones.}

  abstract = {This study aims to identify individual patterns of adolescents' views on democracy, adolescents' transitions between the patterns over time, and individual-level predictors of these transitions. Two waves of longitudinal survey data from 768 Czech high school students (T1 mean age 15.97) were analyzed using latent transition analysis. Results suggested three basic patterns of adolescents' views on democracy: majority-oriented (disregarding minority rights and interests), conventional (having narrowed understanding of civil liberties), and liberal (supporting both minority rights and civil liberties). Of these, the liberal view pattern was the least stable over time, and its stability was linked to adolescents' institutional trust and civic participation. Specifically, adolescents who were less trusting of institutions were more likely to adopt the majority-oriented (vs. liberal) view, while less civically active adolescents were more likely to switch to the conventional view. Authoritarianism was linked to adolescents' initial views, but it did not predict change over time. \textcopyright{} 2019},

Two waves of longitudinal survey data from 768 Czech high school students (T1 mean age 15.97) were analyzed using latent transition analysis. Results suggested three basic patterns of adolescents' views on democracy: majority-oriented (disregarding minority rights and interests), conventional (having narrowed understanding of civil liberties), and liberal (supporting both minority rights and civil liberties). Of these, the liberal view pattern was the least stable over time, and its stability was linked to adolescents' institutional trust and civic participation. Specifically, adolescents who were less trusting of institutions were more likely to adopt the majority-oriented (vs. liberal) view, while less civically active adolescents were more likely to switch to the conventional view. Authoritarianism was linked to adolescents' initial views, but it did not predict change over time. \textcopyright{} 2019},

Age differences in attributions for outcomes reflected a strengthening with age of the skill\textendash luck distinction and of equity thinking about wealth. Although men with good outcomes were generally perceived more positively than men with bad outcomes, and likeability was affected only by outcome, 10-year-olds differentiated most sharply among different types of `winners' or `losers', viewing the rich and poor men as more like the winner and loser of a contest of skill than like the winner and loser of a game of chance. Overall, the findings suggest that differential evaluation of rich and poor people may begin as affective tagging based on good or bad life outcomes and later be associated with justifications grounded in an equity perspective on income inequality that emphasizes the role of personal qualities such as ability in wealth accumulation.},

  abstract = {Declining participation in traditional forms of politics has become a central theme for academics and policy-makers, and has often been viewed as marking a crisis in citizenship. While youth participation in electoral politics has declined rapidly in recent decades, participation in issue-based forms of civic and political engagement has actually increased. However, the disconnection of young people from the political system remains a problem. The Conservative Party came to power in May 2010 after the onset of the global financial crisis, and a central theme of Prime Minister Cameron's agenda is the `Big Society', which aims to make citizens `feel both free and powerful enough to help themselves and their own communities'. It has provided the backdrop for concrete policy initiatives designed to decentralise power, further open up public services and create opportunities for citizens to get engaged at the local level. For it to succeed, the Big Society requires a cultural shift in civic and political engagement, for younger citizens (in particular) to embrace these new opportunities. This article evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the Big Society in light of what we know about young people's politics in the UK and beyond.},

Fairness is an everyday term, which in policy hides multiple and contradictory positions across the political divide. In education, we find a policy context that focuses on distributional justice and equality of opportunity but also on principles of freedom and choice. This paper argues that engaging with how young people understand fairness contributes to models of social justice in education. Focus group data and written statements on fairness from approximately 80 young people aged 16-18 from five very different English schools were analysed. Students' primary concerns, absent from educational policy, were the themes of relational justice and stakes fairness, which are eclipsed by current recourse to distributive justice and meritocratic ideals. We argue that a focus on the lived experience of fairness is therefore necessary to widen the discourse about what is fair in education and to reinvigorate public debate about the values on which our education system is based.},

A prominent recent study by Newman, Johnston, and Lown argues that, consistent with the conflict theory, exposure to higher levels of local income inequality leads lower-income people to become more likely to reject\textemdash and higher-income people to become more likely to accept\textemdash the dominant United States ideology of meritocracy. Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the study's own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three distinctly different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis. We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion. Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.},

Information on migration histories of families and gender equality attitudes is collected for over 800 families. Based on those data assimilation and retention theories and theories on intergenerational transmission as a means to reproduce cultural attitudes among migrant families are tested from a dissimilation-from-origin perspective: how do migrants and their descendants differ from non-migrants from the same area of origin. The results of this study support concepts that focus on context- and path-dependency: segmented assimilation is shown in the form that the more traditional migrants who move back to Turkey have children with more traditional views than comparable people without migrant ancestors (retention). At the same time, among lineages that settle in Europe, migration seems to speed up the assimilation process of becoming more supportive of gender equality. Moreover, the youth that grew up in Europe is hardly influenced by the parents' attitudes, whereas the ones growing up in Turkey are. This supports the idea of migration being a transmission belt for intergenerational transmission.},

Drawing data from a sample survey of 2,350 respondents in Shanghai, this study examines the impact of social change on people's values in China. Specifically, we are interested in (1) are there significant differences in values between different generations in China? (2) Do younger generations tend to have more modern values? (3) What are the main factors that affect the differences? The results show that the younger generations in China have already shifted from traditional values to modern values in a recent social transformation process. In addition, the younger generations tend to be more secular. They are more likely to regard self-development as the most important thing in life rather than making contributions to the country and society. Further, the younger generations are more individualistic than the old generations. They are more likely to live according to their own lifestyles regardless of what others think. Thus, they are less likely to follow the traditional collective ideology. Overall, the study shows significant generational gaps in value orientations in China.},

  abstract = {This article argues that public opinion regarding the legitimacy of income differences is influenced by actual income inequality. When income differences are perceived to be high, the public thinks of larger income inequality as legitimate. The phenomenon is explained by the system justification motivation and other psychological processes that favor existing social arrangements. Three experiments show that personal experiences of inequality as well as information regarding national-level income inequality can affect which income differences are thought of as legitimate. A fourth experiment shows that the system justification motivation is a cause of this effect. These results can provide an empirical basis for future studies to assume that the public reacts to inequality with adapted expectations, not increased demands for redistribution.},

Feelings of social exclusion, however, may be the result of psychological processes and in particular of (in)justice experiences. Based on just-world research, we hypothesized that (1) the more young people feel treated justly by parents, peers, and teachers and (2) the stronger their personal belief in a just world (BJW), the less they should feel socially excluded, and (3) their justice experiences mediate the effect of the personal BJW. In this article, we analyze the data from two late-adolescent samples to test these hypotheses (Study 1: N = 142 students from two academic-track secondary schools; Study 2: N = 154 students aiming for vocational or intermediate degrees). Hierarchical regression analyses consistently revealed that (a) psychological factors significantly explained feelings of social exclusion, whereas sociological factors did so only marginally, and (b) justice experiences significantly explained feelings of exclusion and (c) fully mediated the effect of the personal BJW. Results further suggest that the feelings of exclusion can be meaningfully categorized according to the context (e.g., society in general vs. school) and that context-related feelings of exclusion can be explained by different justice experiences.},

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of the study of political participation in the last fifty years reflects the crucial significance of citizens' involvement for democratic decision-making. Starting with a strong focus on voting and electoral participation in the 1940s and 1950s, by now the repertoire of gaining influence includes such activities as casting a vote, visiting the burgomaster, signing petitions, donating money, or fighting with the police. Since the scope of government activities and responsibilities has been expanded too in the last few decades, the domain of political participation grew considerable. The combined increase in both the repertoire and the domain of political participation implies that these activities affect virtually all aspects of social life in advanced societies. In other words, the study of political participation has become the study of everything. Two strategies are presented to deal with this situation: the a priori exclusion of specific areas (family, schools, workplace), and the use of more substantive and problemoriented research perspective.}

Considering a variety of political acts, we find that, in the aggregate, African-Americans are slightly, and Latinos are substantially, less active than Anglo-Whites. However, the resources that facilitate participation - some of which, for example, education, are related to social class and others of which, for example, religious preference and activity are associated with race or ethnicity - are distributed very unevently across the three groups, with Latinos at a particular disadvantage. After accounting for differences in politically relevant resources, there is no significant difference among the three groups in political participation.},

The outcome consisted of AE cases diagnosed over the period 1980-1992. High vole density yielded a 10-fold risk (relative risk [RR] = 10.34, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.78-38.39), and the first plateau (400-700 m altitude) compared with the plain (200-400 m) was associated with a large increase in risk (RR = 7.10, 95\% CI = 1.30-38.63). These results confirm that human AE is strongly influenced by the densities of arvicolid species.

Through an analysis of 46 one-on-one in-depth interviews with undergraduates attending Oxford University, we show that students believe in the fairness of the admissions process, while lamenting the lack of opportunities for educational advancement faced by some disadvantaged youth in British society. Despite their understanding that many British youth do not have access to educational experiences that make Oxbridge an attainable goal, most students do not support changes to make access more equitable across class or racial/ethnic lines. This perspective, which legitimates the status students gain through matriculation at an elite university, supports the maintenance of unequal access to an Oxford education despite the advantages that education is known to confer to graduates. The findings demonstrate elites acknowledging the disadvantages of particular groups in society without acknowledging their own advantages in the same system. They do so by recognizing two elements of merit: (1) intelligence, which most students assumed led to their own admission; and (2) cultivation of that intelligence, which requires elite secondary schools and which most students see as disadvantaging particular groups in society.

  abstract = {The present study reflects an exploration of student race and attitudes toward the legal system as predictors of teachers' and administrators' support for police-to-student physical intervention. We experimentally manipulated student race (Black vs. White) in a hypothetical scenario depicting physical police intervention stemming from a student's misbehavior. Teachers and administrators were significantly more punitive (i.e., requested juvenile detention and expulsion) toward the Black student than the White student. Moreover, endorsement of police legitimacy and legal authoritarianism (LA) predicted increased punitive attitudes toward the student, the belief that the student is dangerous, perceived likelihood that the student would recidivate, and perceived appropriateness of police officer behavior. Finally, the relationships between police legitimacy, LA, and perceived police behavior appropriateness were stronger when the student was portrayed as Black than White.},

In the present paper, we argue that because merit is the only track for low status students to reach upward mobility, Belief in School Meritocracy (BSM) is a particularly useful system-justifying tool to help them perceive their place in society as being deserved. Consequently, for low status students (but not high status students), this belief should be related to more general system-justifying beliefs (Study 1). Moreover, low status students should be particularly prone to endorsing this belief when their place within a system on which they strongly depend to acquire status is challenged (Study 2). In Study 1, high status (boys and high SES) were compared to low status (girls and low SES) high school students. Results indicated that BSM was related to system-justifying beliefs only for low SES students and for girls, but not for high SES students or for boys. In Study 2, university students were exposed (or not) to information about an important selection process that occurs at the university, depending on the condition. Their subjective status was assessed. Although such a confrontation reduced BSM for high subjective SES students, it tended to enhance it for low subjective SES students.

  abstract = {In this chapter we discuss development during the early and middle adolescent years (approximately ages 10 to 20), updating the chapter on this topic from the first edition of this Handbook. Because this Handbook is for the educational psychology audience, we focus primarily on changes in adolescents' cognition and motivation, and how these changes influence adolescents' achievement. We also consider briefly the important biological changes that occur at adolescence. We take an interactionist approach in this chapter, as we believe adolescent development reflects changes within the individual, as well as changes in the environments and relationships adolescents experience. Thus we discuss changes in the major contexts and relationships in adolescents' lives, including the peer group, the family, and school. Within many of the sections we discuss gender and ethnic differences in the psychological constructs and contexts discussed. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that adolescence is very much a cultural phenomenon, and the experiences adolescents have vary greatly across different cultures. We focus in this chapter primarily on adolescent development in the United States. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)}

A comparative analysis of gender attitudes in 72 countries shows that citizens of the most democratized countries have more egalitarian gender attitudes in politics, business and access to university education and employment, and that determinants of gender attitudes vary by sex and socio-political context.},

  abstract = {Testing multilevel mediation using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) has gained tremendous popularity in recent years. However, potential confounding in multilevel mediation effect estimates can arise in these models when within-group effects differ from between-group effects. This study summarizes three types of HLM-based multilevel mediation models, and then explains that in two types of these models confounding can be produced and erroneous conclusions may be derived when using popularly recommended procedures. A Monte Carlo simulation study illustrates that these procedures can underestimate or overestimate true mediation effects. Recommendations are provided for appropriately testing multilevel mediation and for differentiating within-group versus between-group effects in multilevel settings.},

We integrate two theories into the conceptualisation of political socialisations of students with and without immigration backgrounds: The theory of social capital conceptualises trust as a generalisation of positive social relationships, whereas the theory of the critical citizen implies that institutions need knowledgeable and scrutinising citizens for democratic improvements. This paper investigates the role of the school setting for political socialisation concerning TIPI using weighted German data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 (N = 1451 students in 59 classes; 52\% were girls; mean age was 14.29; 40\% of participants had immigration backgrounds). Students with immigration backgrounds reported relatively worse social relationships and bestowed less TIPI compared to their peers without immigration backgrounds. As predicted by the theory of social capital, all groups of students bestowed more TIPI if they experienced positive relationships at school to a higher degree. A weaker predictive power of civic knowledge on TIPI for students with immigration background supports notions of the critical citizen. Results indicate that social relationships are relevant for the formation of TIPI of all students, while the role of civic knowledge varies between social groups.},
