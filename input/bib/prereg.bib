  abstract = {The role of 'fair' institutions in developing democratic legitimacy has received increased attention. Citizens who perceive on basis of past experiences that they are being treated fairly by authorities have been held to have greater trust in political institutions. However, previous studies on the relationship between procedural fairness and political trust have not paid sufficient attention to individuals with limited first-hand experiences of authorities. We examine the relationship on an authority that virtually all individuals meet early in life: the school. Using structural equation modeling on unique panel data covering 1500 Swedish adolescents (ages ranging from 13 to 17), we find a reciprocal relationship: personal encounters with school authorities shape young people's political trust; however, the images that adolescents get of the political system (through family, peers, media and so on) have also consequences on their perceptions about the authorities they encounter in their daily lives. The analysis increases our understanding of how individuals form their political allegiances by showing that the relationship between fairness and trust is more dynamic than has previously been suggested: neither an accumulated set of experiences of authorities nor formal ties with political institutions (as voters and so on) are required for a relationship to emerge.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the relationship between socialization and inequality, exploring the case of the working class in Portugal. Bringing together different sociologic traditions, the framework draws upon Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and practices, balanced with recent research on life histories, globalization and individualization. The life stories of 52 workers produced in the context of an adult education programme are analysed, focusing on two major topics: life pathways and class trajectories, and subjectivity, identity and values (stressing the weak class consciousness). The article discusses the potentialities/challenges of using the biographical method to study socialization and inequalities, particularly when developed in educational contexts. According to the analysis, life pathways are often branded by temporary rural, industrial and services work experiences, crossed by turning points' and dramatic moments, though with some generational and gender differences. Classes are seldom referred to, but narratives are framed by key socialization institutions (work, family, local community, church, army) and a sense of deficit, pride and shame, linked to the inequalities structure. Although a pervasive economic, cultural and political change from the 1960s on is evident, our research found key features of a working-class habitus, rooted in specific life paths and socialization institutions. These are likely to be stretched in the current context of economic crisis and neoliberal policies in southern Europe.},

In addition, we provide 10 specific best-practice recommendations regarding persistent and important challenges that researchers face before and after data collection to improve the accuracy of substantive conclusions involving cross-level interaction effects. Our recommendations provide guidance on how to define the cross-level interaction effect, compute statistical power and make research design decisions, test hypotheses with various types of moderator variables (e.g., continuous, categorical), rescale (i.e., center) predictors, graph the cross-level interaction effect, interpret interactions given the symmetrical nature of such effects, test multiple cross-level interaction hypotheses, test cross-level interactions involving more than two levels of nesting, compute effect-size estimates and interpret the practical importance of a cross-level interaction effect, and report results regarding the multilevel model building process.},

  abstract = {This study examines a recent reform in the Swedish teaching professionthe so-called first teacher reform, aimed at increasing teacher professionalism and the status of teachers. The reform created a situation by which a new role had to be created and inhabited by first teachers, appointed on what were considered arbitrary criteria. There were few existing norms, rules, and routines to draw upon for the newly appointed first teachers. The empirical focus of this study, based upon interviews and observations from seven schools in four Swedish municipalities, is how the newly appointed first teachers shape their role in relation to other teachers and to school management. We contribute to inhabited institutions theory by showing how processes of institutional change rely on externalization by relational work, through which the new role gains legitimacy and mutual recognition, and on objectification by jurisdictional work, through which the new role becomes taken for granted in a new division of labour. We thus argue that changes in the material basis of work processes are key to understanding processes of institutional inhabitation. Moreover, we show how changes in intra-professional jurisdictions can lead to upgrading, rather than degradation, of professional work.},

Within the research framework of situational political socialisation, a transactional methodological approach is contributed and analytically demonstrated with an empirical analysis of political norms in action. Political socialisation is handled as an observable communication and meaning-making practice, thus implying a subjective, situational, relational, participation and action-oriented approach in order to counteract the risks of treating the rising generation as depoliticised objects for political fostering.},

The data were analysed using the HLM multilevel analysis program with respect to the four higher order value components, namely self-transcendence, self-enhancement, conservation and openness to change in order to identify student level and school level effects on the values held by the students. Results showed that sex of student, language background, the Christian involvement of the student, parental social position and the values held by parents and peer groups had much greater effects upon the students' values than the schools and their teachers. Further research involving a larger number of schools in a wider variety of settings is suggested to build on this exploratory study.},

In this paper we explore whether rising segregation may in turn erode support for the redistributive policies of the welfare state, further increasing levels of inequality\textemdash a form of positive feedback. The role of the neighbourhood has been neglected in attitudes research but, building on both political geography and `neighbourhood effects' literatures, we theorise that neighbourhood context may shape attitudes through the transmission of attitudes directly and through the accumulation of relevant knowledge. We test this through multilevel modelling of data from England on individual attitudes to redistribution in general and to welfare benefit recipients in particular. We show that the individual factors shaping these attitudes are quite different and that the influence of neighbourhood context also varies as a result. The findings support the idea that neighbourhood context shapes attitudes, with the knowledge accumulation mechanism likely to be the more important. Rising spatial segregation would appear to erode support for redistribution but to increase support for welfare recipients\textemdash at least in a context where the dominant media discourse presents such a stigmatising image of those on welfare benefits.},

Basically, the contribution of socialization research to the analysis of social inequality will be pointed out. From an epistemological point of view it will be argued that selection describes only partially the complexity of socialization processes. As a result the whole characteristic of socialization should not be reduced on mechanisms of selection. Nevertheless, following current research on inequality the input of findings on selection processes is unmistakable when the reproduction of structures of inequality and inequity are analysed.},

But having youth take on the responsibilities of citizenship is jeopardized by America's high level of income inequality and youth in poverty. Poverty contributes to health and social problems, including increased mental illness, drug use, imprisonment rates, school drop-out rates, teenage birth rates, and also decreased rates of social mobility and childhood well being. These conditions block participation in the activities of citizenship by poor youth and their families, compared to wealthier citizens. Thus, the poor are not well represented in the discussions that affect their economic and social lives. Learning to be a good citizen is not easy in low-income families, where youth are distressed and schools are performing poorly. Reforming the nations' schools and increasing rates of participation in democracy may require addressing issues of income inequality and poverty, rather than most other current efforts.},

More specifically, we analyze the process of intergenerational transmission of political preferences within the family using both perceived measures of one family member (i.e. the adolescent respondent) on the one hand and actual preferences (measured among father, mother and child separately) on the other hand to make statements on data reliability. We build on the results of the Parent-Child Socialization Study (PCSS), conducted in Belgium among 2,085 mother/father/child triads. In this survey, respondents were questioned not only about their own voting intention, but also about the perceived vote of the other family members. Results show that there is indeed an important difference between the two. First, adolescents tend to vastly overestimate the political correspondence between themselves and their parents. Second, our analyses suggest that using perceptions of vote choice would lead socialization researchers to very different or even opposite results than using the actual individual vote choices. The study shows that one should be very careful when interpreting the socializing effects of other social network members, when these other members were not surveyed or interviewed themselves.},

Despite the importance of political inequality, not enough is known about the mechanisms that reproduce it. Political socialization research has focused on the transmission of political attitudes and culture across generations, but it has paid scant attention to how family transfers of economic resources, human capital, and social capital reproduce and perpetuate unequal patterns of political involvement and political authority. This article argues that more attention should be paid to measuring the persistence of political identity, political participation, civic engagement, and political influence networks over time and across generations. Special attention should be devoted to learning more about how the passage of family resources (economic resources, human capital, social capital, and cultural capital) from parents to children reproduces political inequality and reduces the opportunity for political mobility. Current data sources fall far short of what is needed to answer these questions, but linking the proposed American Opportunity Study with public voting records and with the American National Election Studies would provide a rich and powerful dataset for studying them.},

We present the corner stones of the conceptual "trident" of social inequality, life course transitions, and adolescent development and identify three major themes the eleven contributions to this special issue address within this conceptual framework: social and individual prerequisites and consequences of coping with life course transitions; intergenerational transmission belts of social inequality; socialization of agency in and outside the family home.

The socioeconomic gap in tolerance of corruption was mainly present between schools.

Contrary to stereotypes of a homogeneously tradition-bound continent, African citizens report high levels of agreement with gender equality that are more easily understood with reference to global processes of ideational diffusion than to country-level differences in economic modernization or women's public-sphere roles. Multivariate analyses suggest, however, that gender liberalism in Africa may be spreading through mechanisms not typically considered by world-society scholars: Support for equal rights is largely unrelated to countries' formal ties to the world system, but it is stronger among persons who are more exposed to extra-local culture, including through internet and mobile phone usage, news access, and urban residency. Forces for gender liberalism are conditioned, moreover, by local religious cultures and gender structures.},

La confianza pol\'itica es especialmente importante en las democracias no solo para sostener y construir la cohesi\'on social, sino tambi\'en para alentar a los ciudadanos a trabajar juntos por los principios democr\'aticos. En este cap\'itulo nos propusimos investigar el papel de las escuelas y la contribuci\'on que pueden hacer para generar confianza pol\'itica entre los j\'ovenes. Adem\'as, queremos centrarnos en el uso de modelos multinivel como una t\'ecnica anal\'itica que tiene el potencial de aprovechar los resultados en diferentes niveles de los sistemas educativos. La muestra comprend\'ia 23,654 estudiantes de secundaria b\'asica que hab\'ian participado recientemente en el Estudio Internacional de Educaci\'on C\'ivica y Ciudadan\'ia de 2009 (ICCS2009). Los estudiantes fueron seleccionados de escuelas en cinco sociedades asi\'aticas, a saber, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Corea, Taiw\'an y Tailandia. Las escuelas se eligieron mediante muestreo probabil\'istico proporcional y los estudiantes de las escuelas proven\'ian de una sola clase intacta. La edad media de los estudiantes era de 13,5 a\~nos en el momento de la prueba dentro de cada sociedad. Los resultados muestran que las escuelas pueden desempe\~nar un papel en el desarrollo de la confianza pol\'itica en las cinco sociedades que hemos estudiado. Dentro de las sociedades, las escuelas que utilizan procesos y estructuras generalmente democr\'aticos para los estudiantes tienen m\'as probabilidades de generar confianza pol\'itica que las que no lo hacen. Sin embargo, existe una diferencia sustancial entre sociedades en los mecanismos a trav\'es de los cuales la escuela influye en la confianza pol\'itica de los estudiantes. Adem\'as, se observan matices en las sociedades en cuanto a g\'enero y roles parentales. Los hallazgos reportados en este cap\'itulo han proporcionado informaci\'on importante para futuras investigaciones sobre la socializaci\'on pol\'itica de los adolescentes. \textcopyright{} 2011 por Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

  abstract = {This article investigates justice judgments concerning grading. In two studies with secondary students (N1=350 academic-track students; N2=225 intermediate [n=81] and academic-track students [n=144]) attending the 7th to the 12th grade level, participants were presented with vignettes describing three different grading systems: criterion-referenced grading, norm-referenced grading, and individual-referenced grading. The subjects graded and other situational characteristics were varied. In both studies, factor analyses consistently revealed that students' justice judgments were contingent on the comparison standard applied, but independent of other situational characteristics. Criterion-referenced grading was rated as the most just practice, individual-referenced grading as almost just, and norm-referenced grading as almost unjust. The better the grades received the more the students evaluated criterion-referenced grading to be just. Students attending intermediate-track schools did not object to norm-referenced grading as strongly as their peers at academic-track schools did. Consequences for teachers' grading practices are discussed.},

A lower socioeconomic status is related to lower intended political participation of adolescents. Within this context, schools play a crucial role in political socialisation, as citizenship education is assumed to either equalise or maintain these social disparities. We analyse a sub-dataset of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 which includes 14-year-old students in four European countries: Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia) and the Netherlands. Multi-level regression analyses reveal that formal citizenship education compensates the relationship between students' socioeconomic status and intended electoral participation in Denmark, Germany (NRW) and the Netherlands, but not in Belgium (FL). Further, the composition of school classes is related to the perception of an open classroom climate in each of the four countries and to participation in civic activities at school in three countries.},

We find that when a parent holds a more discriminatory attitude, his or her child is about 11 percentage points more likely to hold the view. We find that parents hold greater sway over students' gender attitudes than their peers do, and that mothers influence children's gender attitudes more than fathers. Parental attitudes influence child attitudes more in Scheduled Caste communities and student gender attitudes are positively correlated with behaviours such as interacting with children of the opposite gender.},

Similarly, social identity theory has identified the conditions that lead individuals to challenge unequal social systems. Integrating these two major theories, the current study examined the processes underlying the relationship between intergroup contact and participants' willingness to engage in collective action to challenge social inequality. Specifically, we tested sociostructural variables (status legitimacy and stability, and permeability of group boundaries) as potential mediators of contact in a sample of both advantaged (Italian high school students, N = 392) and disadvantaged (immigrant high school students, N = 165) group members. We found that contact was positively associated with motivation for change, an effect mediated by decreased perceived legitimacy of status differences. Moreover, for the advantaged group, membership salience moderated the effects of quality (but not quantity) of contact. Indirect effects were instead not moderated by content of contact (an index considering the extent to which contact was characterized by a focus on differences vs. commonalities between groups). Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.},

We considered students' individual experience of teacher and classmate justice as possible mediators of these relations, and statistically controlled for student sex, internet use, empathy, and social desirability. Bootstrap mediation analyses showed that the more students endorsed personal BJW, the more they evaluated their teachers' and classmates' behavior toward them personally as just, and the less likely they were to report that they cyber-bullied others or were victims of cyber-bullying. The students' individual experiences of teacher justice mediated the association between personal BJW and cyber-bullying perpetration, whereas their experience of classmate justice mediated the relation between personal BJW and cyber-bullying victimization. The pattern of results persisted when we controlled for student sex, average internet use per day, empathy, and social desirability. We discuss the adaptive functions of BJW and implications for future school research and practice.},

At the individual level, education strengthens support for education-based meritocracy but has less impact on perceptions of meritocracy. National indicators are also associated with perceived and preferred meritocracy. Perceived meritocracy is correlated with the expansion of the education system, while the support for education-based meritocracy is correlated with average returns to education. We also find that perceptions and preferences may be affected by such national characteristics as inequality and the average wealth.},

This longitudinal study examined the bidirectional relationships of classroom justice with students' behavioral problems, well-being, and joy of learning. Using systematic observation on the singlechild level, teachers and external observers made high and low inference justice ratings of 245 primary school students. The justice ratings measured two aspects of classroom justice: pedagogical practices and teacher\textendash child interactions. Results indicate that there is a bidirectional relationship between behavioral problems and classroom justice. On the one hand, behavioral problems led to a decrease in the respectfulness of teacher\textendash child interactions as rated by the teachers. On the other hand, just pedagogical practices as rated by external observers led to decreases in the children's behavioral problems but also in their joy of learning. There was a negative effect of justice sensitivity on joy of learning. These results might be due to teachers' adaptiveness. Teachers might especially focus their attention and efforts on the children who seem to need them the most, for instance, children with a low joy of learning or behavioral problems. These results might be used to sensitize teachers and school developers to the importance of classroom justice.},

Children frequently explained disparities in terms of institutions' differing financial resources, revealing awareness that economic inequalities often underlie groups' differential access to societal resources. Further, children attributed inequalities to differential treatment more often when they witnessed' African-Americans at a disadvantage than when they witnessed European Americans at a disadvantage, demonstrating awareness that racial minority groups are more likely to experience restricted access to resources. Finally, children who reasoned about differential treatment judged inequality, and actions that perpetuated inequality, more negatively than children who attributed inequalities to institutions' differing needs, revealing a link between awareness of discrimination and rejection of social inequalities.

  abstract = {Recently there has been a surge in econometric work focusing on estimating average treatment effects under various sets of assumptions. One strand of this literature has developed methods for estimating average treatment effects for a binary treatment under assumptions variously described as exogeneity, unconfoundedness, or selection on observables. The implication of these assumptions is that systematic (for example, average or distributional) differences in outcomes between treated and control units with the same values for the covariates are attributable to the treatment. Recent analysis has considered estimation and inference for average treatment effects under weaker assumptions than typical of the earlier literature by avoiding distributional and functional-form assump-tions. Various methods of semiparametric estimation have been proposed, including estimating the unknown regression functions, matching, meth-ods using the propensity score such as weighting and blocking, and combinations of these approaches. In this paper I review the state of this literature and discuss some of its unanswered questions, focusing in particular on the practical implementation of these methods, the plausi-bility of this exogeneity assumption in economic applications, the relative performance of the various semiparametric estimators when the key assumptions (unconfoundedness and overlap) are satisfied, alternative estimands such as quantile treatment effects, and alternate methods such as Bayesian inference.},

Results showed that tolerance towards immigrants should be treated as a two-dimensional concept: support for equal rights, focused on equality in labour market, housing or access to education, and support for cultural rights, encompassing acceptance of immigrants' rights to practice their culture and religion. We found that Czech adolescents were generally more supportive of equal rights than of cultural rights, and that out-group trust explained most of the variance for both dimensions of tolerance towards immigrants. The study also indicated ambiguous effects in the relationship between right-wing authoritarianism, repression potential and support for equal/cultural rights of immigrants with out-group trust used as moderating variable.},

In the present cross-sectional study, associations between students' perceptions of school climate dimensions and their level of engagement were explored. The differential effects on these associations of sex and social background were also examined. Results from a sample of 955 high-school students showed that a model incorporating six dimensions of perceived school climate explained a large proportion of the variance in students' engagement, especially affective engagement. The perceived climate of relations between teachers and students appeared to be highly predictive of students' engagement. Analyses also revealed that the predictiveness of school climate factors for affective, cognitive and behavioral engagement varied slightly according to sex and social background.

Youth report more confidence in social authorities than in legal authorities. Furthermore, whereas confidence in social authorities remained largely stable between the cohorts over the last decade, confidence in legal authorities, and in law enforcement in particular, has declined markedly. Although there may be an era of mistrust in legal authorities, it cannot be attributed to a ubiquitous anti-authority attitude among modern adolescents in the United States.},

Considering the case of Argentina, the article analyzes the impact of the third dimension -police corporativeness- contrasting the cases of the Federal Police in the Buenos Aires Capital District, the Provincial Police in the surrounding area of Buenos Aires, and the case of Carabineros in Chile. The main claim of this article is that organized civil society has an greater impact over agenda setting than over policy implementation even in cases where civil society is strong. Moreover, institutional factors play a crucial role in solving the question of when and where the influence of civil society is more likely.},

We therefore present a comprehensive framework to integrate empirical data and theoretical insights into the citizenship of young people today. To develop and validate the framework, we conducted exploratory and confirmative factor analyses on measures of citizenship attitudes, skills, reflection and knowledge for a sample of 7,768 students in grades 5\textendash 9 from 38 Dutch primary and secondary schools. The results were cross-validated using a different sample of 15,940 students in primary and secondary education. We were able to distinguish four citizenship orientations among students (societal interest, prosocial ability, reflective thinking and assertiveness) and two domains of citizenship knowledge (societal knowledge and interpersonal knowledge). This framework can help with the large-scale, empirical evaluation of the effects of citizenship education and also guide schools in the formulation of educational goals to support the development of citizenship competences among students.},

In this paper we assess some of the empirical links between police legitimacy, political ideology (right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and support for `reasonable' use of force (e.g. an officer striking a citizen in self-defence) and `excessive' use of force (e.g. an officer using violence to arrest an unarmed person who is not offering violent resistance). Analysing data from an online survey with US participants (n = 186) we find that legitimacy is a positive predictor of reasonable but not excessive police use of force, and that political ideology predicts support for excessive but not reasonable use of force. We conclude with the idea that legitimacy places normative constraints around police power. On the one hand, legitimacy is associated with increased support for the use of force, but only when violence is bounded within certain acceptable limits. On the other hand, excessive use of force seems to require an extra-legal justification that is \textendash{} at least in our analysis \textendash{} partly ideological. Our findings open up a new direction of research in what is currently a rather sparse psychological literature on the ability of legitimacy to `tame' coercive power.},

The current wave of activism is different largely because the ever-present minorities of militant faculty and student activists have gained significant reinforcements in their struggle to transform the culture and mission of higher education. Over the last several decades federal regulations and funds have created an alternative bureaucracy within universities that is devoted, not to the core academic mission of teaching and research, but to improving the social climate of university life. The legitimacy and power of the social climate bureaucracy depend on heightening the perception that academic life involves a dangerous environment, from which students need protection - a service provided through creating safe spaces, helping students to recognize micro-aggressions, training them in sexual assault prevention, conducting sensitivity training for faculty and the like. Devoted to heightening this perception of the university campus as a hostile environment, the climate bureaucracy has become a source of institutionalized discontent.},

Higher inequality is thought to increase demand for income redistribution in democracies and to discourage democratization and promote class conflict and revolution in dictatorships. Most such arguments crucially assume that ordinary people know how high inequality is, how it has been changing, and where they fit in the income distribution. Using a variety of large, cross-national surveys, we show that, in recent years, ordinary people have had little idea about such things. What they think they know is often wrong. Widespread ignorance and misperceptions emerge robustly, regardless of data source, operationalization, and measurement method. Moreover, perceived inequality\textemdash not the actual level\textemdash correlates strongly with demand for redistribution and reported conflict between rich and poor. We suggest that most theories about political effects of inequality need to be reframed as theories about effects of perceived inequality.},

The analysis is conducted in the context of 17 European societies. The data for the analysis were obtained from the 2014 European Social Survey (ESS). The main findings lead to the conclusion that misperceptions of the size of immigrant population play a more important role than factual reality in shaping public views and attitudes toward immigration. Although perceived size is not totally detached from actual size, the discrepancy between actual and perceived size is found to be a more powerful predictor of opposition to immigration than actual size. The more inflated is the misperception the more pronounced is opposition to immigration. The impact of misperceptions, when measured as a discrepancy or a ratio, on anti-immigrant attitudes is more pronounced in countries with, proportionally, a large foreign-born population. The meaning of the findings and the relevance of misperceptions and cognitive maps in shaping public views are discussed.},

Such research also has broader implications for adolescent legal socialization, which have been largely underdeveloped. A renewed effort to connect psychological research with legal policy must expand beyond these beginnings to focus on all adolescents and their engagement in broader social institutions. Specifically, a consideration of the unique capacities for growth and development during the adolescent years should be leveraged toward fostering positive outcomes like community identity, academic and social achievement, and the development of an orientation toward law based upon legitimacy and trust. Studies suggest that a key component of positive socialization is dealing with authorities one experiences as procedurally just. Researchers focused on issues of juvenile justice should also expand their focus to consider how the social climate in institutions such as schools can be designed to take advantage of the unique capacities adolescents have for exploring identity and connecting with peers in developing their orientation to the law and legal authorities.},

In Phase 1, teachers were interviewed about their goals and considerations for classroom seating arrangements. Teachers mentioned between 2 and 19 reasons for placing students at specific places in the classroom, with mostly academic considerations. They mainly preferred arrangements in small groups to promote student cooperation. In Phase 2, teachers completed a questionnaire about seating arrangements. This allowed us to examine individual differences between teachers related to gender, years of experience, and beliefs, and the concurrence between the interview and questionnaire data. Teachers reported multiple and various considerations for seating arrangements. Correlations with their general student-oriented or subject-oriented beliefs and personal characteristics were low. The concurrence between measurement methods also was low. The discussion focused on teacher awareness of classroom seating arrangements as an important part of classroom management and a tool for prevention and intervention.},

Conversely, living overseas had a negative effect on respondents' support for Chinese democratization, as the longer they had lived in the United States, the better they understood Western democracy and were suspicious about whether China should pursue immediate democratization. Meanwhile, we also find Chinese media has a negative impact on public support for democracy, both instrumental and intrinsic.

In questioning these assumptions, the chapter provides five examples that complicate how change may manifest in children and young people's participation. More specifically, the chapter draws on empirical examples of change that is messy and unpredictable in the United Kingdom, unwanted in the United States, quantitative in Finland, radical in South Africa, and that offers a `strategic opportunity' in Australia.},

This article has twin objectives: to explore the ways in which government-directed civics education programmes have fallen short; and to argue for a shift in our approaches to civics education, in terms of both content and delivery, drawing on the surplus model, which credits students with unique ideas, knowledge and experiences. We draw upon Justice Citizens, an alternative approach to Civics Education that foregrounds students' own interests and abilities as central to their development into active citizens as an example of the educational practices that can promote and strengthen active citizenship among school students. From this programme and other research, we discuss four student-centred themes that should inform further civics education curriculum development.},

  abstract = {Based on a study of 12,000 elementary schoolchildren in eight large and medium-sized American cities, this book presents the first large-scale study of political attitude formation in children. The authors view political development from the perspective of a general theory of socialization, and compare the influences of social class, intelligence, teacher attitude, and religious membershipon the growth of political attitudes. The book outlines the way in which the child\&\#39;s political awareness evolvesfrom identification with authority figures such as father, policeman, the president, to a grasp of more abstract political concepts and the rudiments of political participation. Illuminating a topic of great theoretical concern and practical educational importance, the book is a significant contribution to the fields of political sociology, child development and educational psychology, and an important reference work for all concerned with the processes of socialization and of attitude formation in general. The Development of Political Attitudes in Children was based on a major survey, the first of its kind, begun at the University of Chicago in 1960 to ascertain information about the induction of children into the political life of the United States, to describe the nature of socialization into citizenship roles, and to examine pre-adult political learning and behavior in terms of other implications for the stability of the political system. Professor Frederick Frey of MIT described it as \&quot;an indispensable work for all who are trying to develop this new and tremendously important vineyardas nearly indispensable as any book of the past several years.\&quot; \&quot;Their verbatim interviews with grade-schoolers are pungent and entertaining.

We design research to remedy this. First, we contribute to the literature by advancing research that distinguishes analytically between the two phenomena. We conceptualize tolerance as a value orientation towards difference. This definition\textemdash which is abstract and does not capture attitudes towards specific out-groups, ideas, or behaviors\textemdash allows for the analysis of tolerance within and between societies. Second, we improve the measurement of tolerance by developing survey items that are consistent with this conceptualization. We administer two surveys, one national (Sweden) and one cross-national (Australia, Denmark, Great Britain, Sweden, and the United States). Results from structural equation models show that tolerance is best understood as a three-dimensional concept, which includes acceptance of, respect for, and appreciation of difference. Analyses show that measures of tolerance have metric invariance across countries, and additional tests demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity. We also assess tolerance's relationship to prejudice and find that only an appreciation of difference has the potential to reduce prejudice. We conclude that it is not only possible to measure tolerance in a way that is distinct from prejudice but also necessary if we are to understand the causes and consequences of tolerance.},

While the Singapore education system is not unique in its stratification of students into distinct educational tracks with diverse educational outcomes, it is one of the very few countries with explicitly differentiated formal national citizenship curricula for students from different educational tracks. Students are formally allocated different citizenship roles and responsibilities according to the hierarchy defined by the state. Three distinct roles can be identified: (1) elite cosmopolitan leaders; (2) globally-oriented but locally-rooted mid-level executives and workers; and (3) local 'heartlander' followers. To cater to these different citizen roles, the three programmes encompass significantly different curricular goals, content, modes of assessment, civic skills, and values. The findings indicate that only the elite students have access to citizenship education that promotes democratic enlightenment and political engagement. The social studies curriculum for students in the vocational track, in contrast, focuses almost exclusively on imparting a pre-determined body of knowledge and set of values deemed necessary for academically low-achieving students.},

Gritty students miss less class time and are more engaged in their schools, are more politically efficacious, are more likely to intend to vote when they become eligible, and volunteer more. Our work highlights the value of psychosocial attributes in the political socialization of young people.},

While some authors assume a direct socialisation effect of educational experience, others have argued that education should be seen as a mere proxy variable for socio-economic status and pre-adult socialisation experiences. In this article we use a 5-year Belgian panel study that tracked respondents between the ages of 16 and 21. Using a hierarchical linear model of repeated measurements, we are able to demonstrate that differences with regard to political trust between future students and non-students are already present and stable at the age of sixteen. Significant determinants were school track and educational goal. The inclusion of actual educational status in the model (at age 21), however, rendered the relation with educational goal not significant. The results suggest that during secondary education students already anticipate and acquire a value pattern that is congruent with their future status. Ultimately, however, this effect is dependent on whether they actually enrol in higher education or not.},

In this introduction, it is argued that, because of this generational replacement mechanism, youth studies offer us a glimpse of the future evolution of western political systems.

To explain these differences, studies have primarily focused on the role of macro level differences and have only theoretically acknowledged how the role of diverging socialization experiences could also be responsible. To date, little is known about the importance of socialization for attitudes toward income inequality. This article assesses whether the differences between Western and post-socialist countries are influenced by socialization effects. Applying an adapted age-period-cohort analysis on the dataset of the International Social Survey Program\&rsquo;s (ISSP) \&ldquo;Social Inequality\&rdquo; module in survey years 1992, 1999, and 2009, the paper shows that socialization has a substantial effect on attitudes and a socialist socialization clearly differentiates individuals from post-socialist countries from Westerners. Results underline that experiences gained in formative years are crucial for attitudes. A further finding is that both perception and preferences toward income inequality are influenced by socialization.},

  abstract = {This study reviews international comparative studies investigating people's views on inequality. These studies are classified using a framework consisting of three types of conceptions of inequality and two dimensions of inequality. Four perspectives are discussed explaining cross-national differences in views on inequality: the modernist, the culturalist, the micro and the macro perspective. The findings of studies comparing views on inequalities in post-communist and Western states provide more support for the modernist than for the culturalist perspective. Few comparative studies appear to investigate views on inequalities as independent variables impacting on other social attitudes and behaviours. It is argued that the social relevance of the field will be enhanced if more studies can show that views on inequality have an effect on social outcomes complementary to that of objective inequalities., L'\'etude fait le tour des comparaisons internationales qui ont analys\'e les opinions sur l'in\'egalit\'e. On peut les classer \`a partir de trois conceptions de l'in\'egalit\'e et de deux dimensions. On obtient en fait quatre mod\`eles qui rendent compte des diff\'erences entre nations : le moderniste, le culturaliste, la perspective micro et la perspective macro. Les donn\'ees comparatives pour les pays ex-communistes et les pays occidentaux s'accordent mieux avec une perspective moderniste que culturaliste. Les \'etudes comparatives ont fort peu trait\'e les jugements sur l'in\'egalit\'e comme variables ind\'ependantes ayant un impact sur d'autres attitudes et comportements sociaux. La pertinence sociale de ce champ d'\'etudes serait augment\'ee si davantage d'\'etudes montraient que les jugements sur l'in\'egalit\'e ont des effets sociaux qui s'ajoutent \`a ceux des in\'egalit\'es objectives., Dieser Beitrag interessiert sich f\"ur internationale vergleichende Studien, die die Anschauungen \"uber Ungleichheit zum Thema haben. Diese Studien lassen sich in drei Konzepte und zwei Dimensionen von Ungleichheit einteilen. Daraus entstehen vier Modelle, die die unterschiedlichen nationalen Betrachtungsweisen von Ungleichheit erkl\"aren: die modernistische Perspektive, die kulturelle Perspektive, die Mikroperspektive und die Makroperspektive. Die vergleichenden Angaben ehemaliger kommunistischer und westlicher L\"ander stimmen eher mit der modernistischen als mit der kulturalistischen Perspektive \"uberein. Nur wenige der vergleichenden Studien scheinen Ungleichheiten als unabh\"angige Variablen zu verstehen, die zu anderen sozialen Formen und Verhaltensweisen f\"uhren k\"onnten. Die soziale Bedeutung dieses Studienbereichs k\"onnte zunehmen, falls mehrere Untersuchungen zeigen w\"urden, dass die Einstufungen der Ungleichheit soziale Auswirkungen haben, die zu den objektiven Ungleichheiten hinzugef\"ugt werden m\"ussen.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new theory of distributive justice, one that is fully mathematized and fully testable. The theory describes how choices made by individuals (about which goods to value, which social aggregates to form, and what conditions to regard as just or fair for themselves) combine with two objective structural features\textendash the actual distributions of goods and their intercorrelations\textendash to produce the sentiment of justice in the individual. The theory views social relations as a meeting of justice sentiments. Hence, a social aggregate is characterized by the distribution of justice sentiments experienced by its members; and the social aggregate's characteristic social facts are approximated by the parameters of the distribution of justice sentiments, such parameters as the proportion who feel unjustly underrewarded, the Gini's mean difference, the lower extreme value, the overall mean, and many others. By holding constant both the goods of value to the members of a social aggregate and the condition regarded by them as just or fair, it becomes possible to generate expected distributions of justice sentiments from knowledge of the actual distributions of goods, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the theory. In this paper, using three hypothetical distributions of goods (Rectangular, Pareto, and Lognormal), we generate the corresponding expected justice distributions\textendash one negatively skewed Exponential, a family of positively skewed Exponentials, and a family of Normals\textendash and evaluate many parameters of interest.},

  abstract = {Among a child's skills and competencies, conscientiousness has been shown to be one of the most important predictors of school performance and later academic achievement. We refer this insight to the social reproduction of social inequality: Is socialization of personality characteristics in the parental home a significant mechanism that contributes to a child's life chances? Using school grades as the outcome measure, we combine different pathways toward their achievement: the impact of a child's conscientiousness on school grades, parental conscientiousness and parental stratification as sources for the differential conscientiousness of children, and the mediation of this interrelationship through different parenting styles. To date, almost no research has been conducted which integrates the unequal formation of personality and its consequences regarding life chances and compares it with the respective influences of social origin. Moreover, we add to existing research in social reproduction the distinction between different facets of conscientiousness. We show that it allows for more precise predictions of academic achievement than looking at the highly aggregated Big Five personality traits; moreover, these facets can be much better linked to the established body of sociological stratification theory. We combine data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and the related Familien in Deutschland (FiD) study involving children 9-10 years of age and their parents and households. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we found theoretical and empirical evidence that only the "focus" facet and not the "orderliness" facet is highly positively correlated with school grades even more than indicators of social background. Our main hypothesis that conscientiousness, specifically the facet focus, acts as one "transmission belt" between social background and school grades was confirmed.

Many individuals express dissatisfaction with the high level of stratification in our society, but at the same time, they hold out the possibility that they themselves will one day rise to the top. Previous research has often focused on cultural explanations for American tolerance of inequality. While there is much support for this characterization of Americans' attitudes towards inequality as being rooted in a deep cultural ambivalence, we hypothesize that tolerance is also affected by structural conditions. Attitudes towards inequality are affected by local reference groups, and thus, individuals do not experience the full extent of inequality in society in their daily lives. Using the General Social Survey data, we investigate attitudes towards inequality within and between counties. We find that individuals' attitudes towards inequality are strongly affected by their relative, county-mean centered income, and that the relationship between relative income and tolerance for inequality is stronger in high-income counties. We infer that high levels of socio-economic segregation in the U.S. increase tolerance for inequality.},

Many scholars think that social stratification of the electorate may lead to differential political representation of social groups thereby weakening the legitimacy of democracy among the lower social strata who participate least in politics. In this respect, it is often argued that one of the roles of schools is to reduce the difference in civic participation among students coming from families in different social strata. In this vein, this article examines if (a) type of classroom learning operationalised as `open classroom climate' and (b) the socioeconomic composition of the class help to explain differences in students' level of civic knowledge and attitudes toward voting. The data used in this study comes from the International Citizenship and Civic Education (ICCS) survey of 8th-grade student carried out in 2009. The multilevel modelling results show that the SES of a students' family does help to explain differences in pupils' civic knowledge and attitudes toward voting, and this classroom effect is especially strong among low SES students. In contrast, the presence of an open classroom climate has no significant effects on knowledge or attitudes to voting. This article concludes with a discussion of how these findings shape current understanding of how contrasting educational trajectories may have political consequences over the long-term.},

Furthermore, the results show that trust in community organizations and local political trust played a more important role as a mediator between localized social media use and civic participation.

This association is typically taken as prima facie evidence of economic self-interest: Classes hold different attitudes, values, and party preferences because they have different economic interests. However, this assumption has rarely been tested empirically. In this article, we use survey data from 18 West European countries to examine why classes differ on a central aspect of political preferences, namely their views on the desirability of income inequality. We find that only a moderate proportion of differences between employee classes in support for redistribution can be accounted for by contemporary differences in resources and risks; differences in economic interests to some degree account for the anti-redistributive preferences of the professional middle classes compared with the working class. However, the preferences of the self-employed have a different explanation; autonomy is a better explanation of the right-wing preferences of the self-employed compared with the working class.},

I find that middle-class young adults had more knowledge than their working-class or poor counterparts of the ``rules of the game'' regarding how institutions worked. They also displayed more of a sense of entitlement to ask for help. When faced with a problem related to an institution, middle-class young adults frequently succeeded in getting their needs accommodated by the institution; working-class and poor young adults were less knowledgeable about and more frustrated by bureaucracies. This address also shows the crucial role of ``cultural guides'' who help upwardly mobile adults navigate institutions. While many studies of class reproduction have looked at key turning points, this address argues that ``small moments'' may be critical in setting the direction of life paths.},

(5) Turnout appears to be declining everywhere. The problem of inequality can be solved by institutional mechanisms that maximize turnout. One option is the combination of voter-friendly registration rules, proportional representation, infrequent elections, weekend voting, and holding less salient elections concurrently with the most important national elections.

However, findings are largely based on Western contexts, and little attention has been paid to the model advanced by Tyler that police legitimacy helps promote compliance. Using a high school sample (N = 711) from China, we follow Tankebe's operationalization and examine the role of legitimacy in youth support for the police and whether legitimacy helps predict compliance with the law. Findings indicate that procedural justice and shared values are strong predictors of youth support to the police, and this support positively predicts compliance with the law. Distributive fairness exerts an independent effect on compliance while having been questioned by the police is negatively related to compliance.},

Building on a literature review, it reports an exploratory case study with students and teachers in four secondary schools in the Ottawa, Canada region. The perspectives of researchers co-operating with educators and students against a backdrop of provincial government curricula and secondary literature on youth citizenship engagement provide an enriched understanding of the state and potential of civic learning. It concludes that current civic learning is primarily characterized by procedural knowledge and compliant codes of behaviour that do not envelope students in collective action for systemic understandings of political issues. This study argues for renewed efforts to put social justice at the heart of student learning. To present a convincing civic educational programme, schools should prepare students to analyse power relationships, investigate the ambiguities of political issues, and embrace opportunities for social change.},

This paper investigates the social roots of that tendency by focusing on the long-term effects of childhood family background on midlife social autonomy. The effects of two aspects of family background are investigated-socioeconomic background and childhood household composition. Family background variables in these categories have small yet theoretically and statistically significant effects on midlife social autonomy. Parental education and occupation are associated with midlife social autonomy among both men and women. Early-life household composition variables and parental income are associated with social autonomy only among women. Adult status variables generally do not mediate the effects of of the family background variables on midlife social autonomy. This suggests that the long-term effects of family background on social autonomy are primarily due to early life socialization. Gender-specific socialization processes are discussed as explanations for these effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Aims This paper presents an experimental study aimed to assess whether, and to what extent, student Self and Other resistant agency depends on perceptions of teacher justice and student achievement. Methods Participants were asked to read one of four scenarios concerning a generic student asking for the possibility to retake a test she/he had previously failed, with an experimental design including two levels of teacher justice \texttimes{} 2 levels of academic achievement. Then, they answered two items regarding the likelihood of protest on the part of the student depicted in the scenario and enforced by themselves in having to deal with a similar situation. Results The multilevel analysis indicated a principal effect of justice and target, with resistant agency rated as more likely in the unjust condition and for the Other. The justice effect was further qualified by an interaction with the achievement level, with resistant agency higher in the unjust and low achievement condition. Finally, a three-way interaction appeared, with Self resistant agency higher in the just and high achievement condition. Conclusions These results are discussed in terms of their implications for teacher practices, as they emphasize the importance just learning environments have in allowing students to express their opinions as well as dissent.},

  abstract = {In western democracies, schools are expected to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of democratic citizenship. Through citizenship education, schools aim to stimulate the development of civic knowledge, skills and attitudes. This dissertation aims to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the different ways in which citizenship education can effectively stimulate civic engagement in adolescence. The dissertation consists of two parts. The first part focusses on discussions in the classroom on political and social issues. In the second part, I investigate how different types of citizenship education relate to the development of democratic attitudes and political participation. This dissertation uses the data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009 and 2016, a high quality and large-scale dataset consisting of representative samples of 14-year-old students. I apply multilevel regression analyses and (multilevel) structural equation modeling using cross-national data or case studies. In the first part of this dissertation, the focus is on classroom discussions on political and social issues, also referred to as 'open classroom climate'. The research question for this first part of the dissertation is: what determines students' perceptions of an open classroom climate? The main results of the analyses, using data of 22 European countries, is that a school context of mutual respect and responsiveness is important for student perceptions of the classroom climate. When students feel equally and respectfully treated by their teachers, they are more likely to perceive their classroom climate as open. Similarly, when the school is responsive towards student demands, the classroom climate is perceived as more open. When policy and schools want to stimulate classroom discussions, they should not overlook the importance of mutual respect and responsiveness. The importance of the school context was also investigated in relation to political tolerance in a Belgian (Flemish) context. The findings show that when classroom discussions are taken into account as a single predictor, the impression is given that political discourse positively affects political tolerance. However, when a respectful and responsive school context is taken into account, the direct relationship between discussions and tolerance disappears. This means that in a Belgian (Flemish) context, respectful treatment by teachers, and responsiveness of the school towards student demands are more important for political tolerance than the discussions themselves. The second part of this dissertation is dedicated to the overall influence of citizenship education on civic engagement. The research question is as follows: how do different types of citizenship education relate to the development of democratic attitudes and political participation? Three types of citizenship education are investigated: civic learning opportunities, open classroom climate and student participation in school policies. The most important finding is that each type of citizenship education contributes in its own way to students' civic engagement. Consequently, the strength of citizenship education lies in a combination of approaches. Looking at the Belgian (Flemish) data, student participation in school policies is the strongest predictor for non-institutionalized participation. For institutionalized participation, civic learning opportunities seem to matter most. In addition, citizenship education is related to political participation in two ways: in a direct way, as more citizenship education is associated with higher levels of political participation, and in an indirect way, as citizenship education is positively associated with political interest and political efficacy, and such political attitudes are in turn positively related to both types of political participation. When investigating online political participation in 21 countries from different continents, the results indicate that all three types of citizenship education are positively related to political participation, but student participation in school policies seems the most effective. Interestingly, adolescents with a migration background and students with less civic knowledge are more politically active online, whereas they are often participate less frequently in traditional modes of participation. Regarding the effect of citizenship education on political attitudes, the findings indicate that civic learning opportunities are particularly useful for stimulating political interest, whereas student participation at school and classroom discussions seem very effective to stimulate political efficacy. The influence of citizenship education on political trust is rather limited. Only civic learning opportunities have a positive effect on trust in political institutions. However, based on procedural fairness theory, findings show that fair treatment by teachers is strongly related to political trust. When investigating the underlying mechanism, the results indicate that being fairly treated by teachers is positively associated with trust in schools, which is in turn associated with higher levels of political trust. To conclude, the results of this dissertation indicate that schools are able to influence students' civic engagement, but the strength of citizenship education lies in the combination of approaches. Each type contributes to civic engagement in a distinct way. In addition, the importance of the school context should not be overlooked. Feeling fairly and respectfully treated by teachers is positively associated with political trust, as well as with student perceptions of the openness of the classroom climate.},

Research shows that open classroom discussions on political issues have a positive effect on political attitudes and behaviour. However, a deeper understanding of why students perceive their classrooms as open for discussion is missing. The purpose of this study is to examine how deliberative democratic theory can be used to explain such perceptions. We argue that the openness of the discussion climate is positively affected by, on the one hand, a context of good student\textendash teacher relations characterised by fairness and respect, and, on the other hand, by the level of collective efficacy, which is the perception of responsiveness of the school towards student demands. Using multilevel analyses on the European data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009), we find that these predictors are significant at the student level and the school level. This means that both the individual experience of a student as well as the average school's score on good student\textendash teacher relations and collective efficacy affect how students perceive the discussion climate. Our findings, based on high-quality survey data from 22 countries, are a significant contribution to clarifying the underlying mechanism leading to an open classroom climate. As such discussions have proven to be an effective way to stimulate political engagement, we conclude that a school context characterised by fairness and responsiveness, should not be overlooked by schools and policy.},

Deliberative democratic theory argues that deliberation can positively influence political tolerance. Within a school environment, discussions on controversial issues are believed to stimulate tolerance amongst adolescents. As previous research offers contradictory findings on the effect of classroom discussions on students' tolerance towards immigrants, this paper takes into account the context in which such discussions take place. We argue that a context of both mutual respect and responsiveness towards student demands is crucial to boosting levels of tolerance amongst adolescents. Using the Belgian (Flemish) sample of ICCS 2009 and 2016 in multilevel path models, we find that the discussion climate itself is not significantly related to tolerance towards immigrants when the school context of respect and responsiveness is taken into account. Based on the results of this article, schools should focus more on making students feel respected and equally treated, and on giving young people the chance to participate in the schools' policy and organization to positively influence political tolerance among students.},

The results indicate that three educational strategies (i.e., classroom discussions, civic learning opportunities, and student participation at school) are positively associated with expected political participation (i.e., institutionalized and noninstitutionalized participation) in a distinct way. A substantial part of this relationship is mediated by political interest and political efficacy.

By comparing ideas about what makes political authorities legitimate, this study in five European democracies and hybrid regimes illuminates the `demand side of political legitimacy'. Using original student survey data, this article compares expectations of students from the Netherlands, France, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia about how political authorities should acquire the right to rule and how they ought to behave when in office. The analysis shows that the respondents across the five countries use similar criteria for granting legitimacy. Across the five countries, throughput and input were more important criteria for legitimacy than the output produced by authorities. Although several country differences were found, these differences did not align with regime type. The findings challenge the widespread view that what kind of authorities people consider legitimate is determined by their socialization in a particular political regimen.},

Although the strikingly high and rising level of economic inequality in the nation has alarmed scholars, pundits, and elected officials alike, research across the social sciences repeatedly concludes that Americans are largely unconcerned about it. Considerable research has documented, for instance, the important role of psychological processes, such as system justification and American Dream ideology, in engendering Americans' relative insensitivity to economic inequality. The present work offers, and reports experimental tests of, a different perspective\textemdash the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality. Specifically, two convenience samples (study 1, n = 480; and study 2, n = 1,305) and one representative sample (study 3, n = 1,501) of American adults were exposed to information about rising economic inequality in the United States (or control information) and then asked about their beliefs regarding the roles of structural (e.g., being born wealthy) and individual (e.g., hard work) factors in getting ahead in society (i.e., opportunity beliefs). They then responded to policy questions regarding the roles of business and government actors in reducing economic inequality. Rather than revealing insensitivity to rising inequality, the results suggest that rising economic inequality in contemporary society can spark skepticism about the existence of economic opportunity in society that, in turn, may motivate support for policies designed to redress economic inequality.},

Drawing on all of the major theoretical traditions in sociological social psychology, its chapters demonstrate the relevance of social psychological processes to this central sociological concern. Each chapter in the volume has a distinct substantive focus, but the chapters will also share common emphases on: \textbullet{} The unique contributions of sociological social psychology \textbullet{} The historical roots of social psychological concepts and theories in classic sociological writings \textbullet{} The complementary and conflicting insights that derive from different social psychological traditions in sociology. This Handbook is of interest to graduate students preparing for careers in social psychology or in inequality, professional sociologists and university/college libraries.},

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between organizational characteristics, state political climate, and student civic engagement at community colleges, operationalized in this article as student voting. Method: Utilizing a unique cross-sectional dataset compiled by the Institute for Democracy \& Higher Education for the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections that merges student voting data, enrollment records from the National Student Clearinghouse, and institutional data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, we employed multi-level binary logistic regression to account for individual and organizational influences. Results: The relationship between voting and student characteristics aligns with national voting trends, in that students who are female, older, and White had higher odds of voting. However, there was one notable exception in 2012 where Black students had higher odds of voting than their White peers. We also found that students enrolled full-time and those enrolled at colleges in electoral battleground states were more likely to vote in 2012 and 2016. Weak or mixed relationships emerged between voting and environmental factors such as campaign spending, ballot initiatives, get-out-the-vote programs, restrictive voter laws, and compositional diversity of the student body. Conclusion: This study provides insight for community college leaders on potential ways to engage students in an effort to promote voter turnout in a presidential election year on their campuses. Specifically, we posit that institutions could highlight the salience of public policy issues for students, lobby for less restrictive voting laws, and implement evaluation programs of their civic engagement initiatives.},

To fill this gap, the authors used data from a new study across 52,300 probabilistically selected respondents from 54 countries. They were asked what advice they would give to their children to instill desirable values and traits in them. Aggregated to the national level, the responses yield two main dimensions of national culture. The first (collectivism-individualism) captures differences approximately along the South-North geographic axis of the Earth and is strongly correlated with differences in economic and gender inequality. The second (monumentalism-flexibility) captures cultural differences approximately on the West-East geographic axis of the world and is strongly associated with national differences in educational achievement. Thus, some of the most important national differences worldwide are strongly related to cultural differences in parental ideologies for the socialization of their children, suggesting that culture has objective societal outcomes.},

This model includes a community dimension, which refers to individual's relationship with their community associations, and a civic dimension, concerning institutional processes such as voting and/or political activism. The model was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and measurement equivalence for eighth-grade students ( n = 139.875) across 38 countries that participated in the International Civic and Citizenship Study (2009).

Ensuring the interaction of the younger generation with the political elite presupposes the existence of certain conditions - the creation and effective functioning of the information infrastructure of youth policy, as well as the conduct of an open active information policy. The article describes the results of a study of the political status of students of the capital of Tatarstan - Kazan, in particular, such parameters as youth interest in political information, trust in the sources of this information, and political participation. Together with the data of secondary studies, this made it possible to characterize the youth sector of political communication, identify the existing difficulties in the interaction of the government and youth, in particular, identify some difficulties in receiving and disseminating political information among the youth, which impede the development of a democratic political culture and the accumulation of social capital of the young generation.},

  abstract = {Physical activity is a health relevant factor, particularly in affluent societies where overweight and obesity are increasingly prevalent, even among children. Understanding the development of physical activity patterns in childhood is thus an important issue for health promotion. Following socialization theory, this study describes and explains differences in objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in a socially and ethnically mixed sample of 6- to 11-year-old children in Germany. MVPA levels were objectively measured with accelerometers over the course of six consecutive days (Wednesday to Monday). Parents' attitudes and practices as well as the family's socio-economic status (SES) were assessed from the parents via questionnaires. Results indicate that MVPA levels of children vary with gender, but not with age and ethnicity. Moreover, parental SES, parental support for the child's sports activities, parents' own sport activities and the parents' belief in sports' capacities to foster personality development, character building and social integration significantly predict the MVPA level of children. It is concluded that interventions to promote MVPA among children need to take family interactions and lifestyles into account and should address families in socio-economically underprivileged areas.},

Without the experience of interacting with people with different policy orientations, it is easy for students to believe policy consensus would emerge if everyone were sufficiently educated on the facts. Factual understanding, however, does not yield consensus on contemporary policy dilemmas such as climate change. We believe that equipping students to be effective agents of change means exposing them to the plurality of cultural commitments and policy orientations latent in current policy disputes. In this paper, we present a preliminary version of a survey tool, the Policy Orientation Survey, to evaluate how the diversity of cultural and policy orientations at a university is distributed across academic units. After describing the tool and its utility, we briefly present pilot results from our own university and discuss implications for higher education.},

Here, we highlight several important areas of theoretical and empirical refinements, which can provide a more nuanced picture of the process through which authoritarian attitudinal legacies emerge and persist. First, we define the nature of attitudinal legacies and their driving mechanisms, developing a framework of competing socialization. Second, we use the competing socialization framework to explain two potential sources of heterogeneity in attitudinal and behavioral legacies: varieties of institutional features of authoritarian regimes, which affect the nature of regime socialization efforts; and variations across different subgroups of (post-)authoritarian citizens, which reflect the nature and strength of alternative socialization efforts. This new framework can help us to better understand contradictory findings in this emerging literature as well as set a new agenda for future research.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to bridge the literature on students' socio-political attitudes with the wider literature on political participation that previously focused on cross-regional differences in participation rates and on varied forms of participation more generally. In doing so, the paper extends the empirical scope of previous analyses by exploring, on the one hand, the extent to which student political participation varies across wide ranges of both party- and protest-related activities; and, on the other hand, by looking at differences in student and non-student participation across 6 countries - 4 old democracies in Western European (WE) and 2 post-communist democracies in Central-Eastern Europe (CEE). Methodologically, the paper combines a quasi-experimental design based on genetic matching with regression models in order to better isolate the effect of student status on political participation from that of age, gender, and family background. Using original survey data gathered within the framework of the POLPART Project among 6,990 respondents, the results for both WE and CEE suggest that students do not significantly differ from non-students in terms of political participation when they are matched on age, gender, and family background. Additionally, when controlling for other variables commonly associated with political participation, such as political interest, students actually appear to engage in party politics less than their non-student counterparts. This indicates that existing college-effects models focusing on the impact of being a student on socio-political attitudes are, at best, spurious. When matching and formally comparing students in WE and in CEE, CEE students appear to be more engaged than their WE counterparts. This indicates that the "apathetic" and "atomistic" perspective on CEE political engagement might not hold for more recent years, especially when it comes to Romania.},

Class climate was assessed in terms of two second-order dimensions: classroom climate (e.g., willingness to learn) and student climate (e.g., community). Multilevel analyses revealed that the more the students evaluated their teachers' behavior toward them personally to be just, the more positively they evaluated the classroom and student climate. Moreover, students with a strong BJW tended to evaluate their teachers' behavior toward them personally to be more just and the climate of their class to be more positive. Furthermore, the experience of teacher justice partly mediated the BJW's effect on the climate evaluations. Thus, a strong BJW seems to function as a personal resource for students, explaining significant parts of their individual experience of both teacher justice and class climate at school. Most importantly, individually experienced teacher justice seems to be a significant factor when it comes to understanding class climate. Implications are discussed.},

Our sample included 69 Italian high school students (35 in the intervention group; 34 in the control group). We evaluated the impact of YPAR using a pretest\textendash posttest control group design and fitting the generalized estimating equations procedure. The results showed that participants in the intervention group reported increased scores on social well-being, institutional trust, and participation and decreased scores on political alienation compared with the control group.

Thus the ethnic majority can champion ethnic minority inclusion without risking ethnic equality. The article therefore challenges a core capitalist assumption, that the market is `the perfect arbiter' and rewards on merit, by underlining the `ethnocratic' context of Israeli hi-tech's meritocracy: while the liberal citizenship discourse enables the ethnic minority to claim citizenship through economic participation, it cannot be separated in practice from an ethnonational citizenship discourse because ostensibly liberal spaces are infused with ethnonational meaning.},

Besides explicit attempts to do so, justice experiences in school may be crucial to develop positive attitudes towards democracy.

We further examined a potential mechanism underlying this relationship, namely general trust, and hypothesized that the relationship between justice experiences in school and democratic attitudes can be understood on the basis of social exchange theory. A total of 210 participants who had visited a public school gave information about their justice experiences in school, general trust, and democratic attitudes. First, it was shown that overall experiences of distributive and interactional justice predict democratic attitudes, more specifically the approval of civic and human rights and the approval of the democratic institutions. Second, we found that the relationships between overall distributive and interactional justice and the approval of civic and human rights, the approval of the democratic institutions, and the approval of democracy-supporting behaviors are each mediated by general trust which can be interpreted as a social exchange process. This study therefore highlights the role of general justice-related school experiences for the development of democratic attitudes.},

In total, 196 students participated in this study and came to the university with their classes to receive extra teaching once a week for six consecutive weeks. To manipulate justice perceptions, a scenario of arbitrary privilege was chosen to lead students of the experimental group to experience injustice from a beneficiary perspective. We found that students in the experimental group reported higher well-being and a higher appreciation of the opportunity to learn than the control group did. Additionally, they showed an increase in justice-related negative emotions over time; that is, they expressed more of a bad conscience and stronger feelings of anger the more they became aware of their privilege. This study shows that even subtle experiences of injustice in school can have an impact on students' outcomes. These results are discussed with regard to practical implications.},

Post-conflict societies experience severe challenges in strengthening political processes and social cohesion. This paper discusses citizenship education at a school run by a non-governmental organization near Monrovia, Liberia, examining the implemented curriculum in an 8th grade civics classroom. The paper details the ways that young people expressed civic critiques within the classroom, and provides a counterstory to narratives of harsh and violent educational environments in the region. This classroom was a space where students and their teacher engaged in talk about contentious issues: students discussed corruption and injustice, and highlighted the relationship between economic and political power. I argue that if the goal of education is to produce engaged, effective citizens, teachers should have pedagogic support to confront the differences between the implemented curriculum and students' lived experiences. Peace education in such contexts must include equipping students to seek justice. Furthermore, because possibilities for civic education are embedded in students' local and national contexts, current global civic education initiatives must be adaptive to local realities.},

  abstract = {While it is often argued that political participation can be measured by both ex ante (intention) and ex post (report) methods (Castillo, Miranda, Bonhomme, Cox, \& Bascope', 2014; Ekstrom \& Ostman, 2013; Hooghe \& Wilkenfeld, 2008; Persson, 2014), some authors claim that intention is a poor predictor of actual participation (Brady, 1999; Furnham \& Gunter, 1989; Norris, 2004) and have even found evidence that the link between intention and behavior is quite weak (LaPiere, 1934). However, to our knowledge, no studies have yet explored how these two measurements of political participation are linked: How strongly are intended and reported political participation correlated, and do the same factors influence the two measures? Although some authors have explored the relationship between intention to vote, reported vote, and validated vote (Achen \& Blais, 2016; Granberg \& Holmberg, 1991), such research is lacking for other political participation activities. For example, voting studies generally find that there is a strong correlation between intention to vote and reported turnout. However, the question remains if the pattern is the same with regard to overall political participation. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the same variables influence intended and reported turnout, but not with the same magnitude. Unfortunately, no such information seems to be available yet for other forms of political participation.},

Therefore, political sociologists have advised to socialize people by encouraging political participation from a young age onward. Parents are one of the most important political socialization agents, especially at a young age. Although the intergenerational transmission of political attitudes has been studied quite intensively, the transmission of the political participation intention has been neglected. This study explores the effect of both mothers' and fathers' political activity on their offspring's intention to participate. Using a data set from 2085 Belgian parent\textendash child triads, we tested the direct and indirect transmission of political participation intention. We found that although there is a direct transmission of political participation intention, after controlling for political discussion, political interest and socio-economic status, this effect is completely mediated. Therefore, we conclude that intergenerational transmission is an indirect process, supported by a high socio-economic status, more political interest and a more politicized family environment in which politics is clearly perceived as salient.},

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 17 middle-class and working-class and poor Mexican American parents, we explore social class patterns in childrearing practices and beliefs. Rather than stark-class differences found in previous work, we observed substantial similarities across social class lines. Our findings suggest that (1) Social mobility experienced by middle-class parents complicate class-based parenting beliefs. (2) Variation in parenting approaches in the same household mitigates class distinctions. (3) Mexican Americans' shared contextual experiences and cultural values minimize social class differences in childrearing. These findings reshape the literature on class differences in parenting and show how social class and race and ethnicity impact childrearing beliefs and practices that are better illuminated when studied as a process.},

This study used two open-ended questionnaires to explore university students' critical incidents of fairness and unfairness and their affective and behavioral reactions to experiences of un/fairness. The findings showed that students' perceptions of CA fairness were comprised of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice principles. Collectively, students considered the distribution of outcomes, the procedures for outcome distributions, the interpersonal relationships, and the communication procedures in conceptualizing fairness. Students also reported positive feelings such as happiness, satisfaction, feeling valued, and hopefulness when describing fair incidents, while they tended to report negative feelings such as anger, upset, disappointment, and embarrassment as responses to unfair incidents. Students also reported increased classroom engagement and greater adaptation in responses to fairness incidents, while they reported class disengagement, inaction, and dissent as responses to unfair incidents. Building on these empirical findings, a more comprehensive conceptualization of fairness in CA contexts is proposed.},

The present study referring to the concepts of situated learning, self-determination and knowledge gap, asks whether young adult's participatory practices (e.g., participation in politics, prior involvement in decision-making at school) predict political knowledge. Analyses that control for multiple predictors of political knowledge suggest differential associations between political knowledge and different participatory practices. Motivational inequality, as defined by interest in politics, moderates the associations with party-political participation and participation at school; the conditional effect of party-related political participation is further moderated by educational resources. Gendered differences are identified for some participatory practices. Directions for future research and the importance of participatory experiences and how to establish a foundation of young citizens' political knowledge are discussed.},

And, in an authoritarian, rule-by-law setting, expressed respect for legality correlates negatively with support for democracy. Whether a country's most democracy-supporting citizens more strongly support legality will depend on whether the legal system is a fair and neutral arena or a tool of undemocratic political authorities.},

In this investigation, we focus on gender differentials in sense of justice about grades, comparing high school students in two educational settings: Israel and Germany. Although the strong norm of equitable distribution of grades would predict no gender differentials in grade allocation, the pattern of results suggest that gender plays a role in both the distribution of this reward and the judgment of fair distribution, therefore affecting students' sense of (in)justice. Similarities as well as certain differences in the comparison of sense of justice of Israeli and German boys and girls are discussed in light of system-specific features.},

The possibility that class composition is a referential structure influencing both actual reward allocation and the determination of entitlement is discussed and investigated empirically in a sample of over 9,000 Israeli junior high students with regard to two academic rewards: grades and ability group placement. The findings suggest that class composition does serve as such a comparison referent and thus affects the perception of deprivation.},

The appeared difference placed science teachers vis-\`a-vis math and language teachers, unlike the expected humanities (language)\textemdash sciences (math and science) dichotomy. Comparison of grading considerations by student capacity suggests that about half of the teachers consider differential grading considerations for ``weak'' and ``strong'' students as just, attributing greater weight to academic input (effort) and need for encouragement when grading their ``weak'' students.},

Following Jasso's definition of the central questions that guide investigation in the justice domain, our discussion in each of these subspheres is structured to deal with the ``just,'' the ``actual,'' and the ``consequences'' of injustice in their distribution, summarizing the theoretical discussion and empirical findings to best of our knowledge.},

This is especially the case in democratic societies, which are based on citizens' participation. Hence, education for citizenship is uniformly considered as a major mission of the common school, along with its central task of imparting knowledge. In this paper we add to the abundant empirical work on the contributing factors to and behavioral consequences of civic education, focusing on the role of the students' sense of justice in school. We refine previous approaches by distinguishing among three dimensions of the sense of justice, two pertaining to the distributive, and one to the procedural justice. We investigate the effects of these dimensions on four kinds of civic behavior relevant to school life: academic dishonesty, violence, extracurricular activity in school and community volunteering. The study was carried out among about 5000 Israeli middle school students (8th and 9th grades). Findings suggest that, overall, students who perceive their teachers as just tend to refrain from violence and to engage to a greater extent in extra-curricular school activity and community volunteering.},

While most studies of the legitimacy of governance actors have focused on the macroregional and national levels, a governance actor may enjoy high legitimacy in one part of a country but be considered illegitimate in other parts. Finally, the multiple sources and consequences of empirical legitimacy in areas of limited statehood have to be analyzed in greater depth.

  abstract = {This article examines the nature of and change in beliefs about inequality and preferences for redistribution in South Africa between 2003 and 2012 using data from the South African Social Attitudes Survey series and 2009 round of the International Social Survey Programme. Inequality aversion, stratification beliefs, perceptions of class tensions and legitimate earnings are tracked, together with support for government redistribution and for specific redress policies. Overall, the findings portray South Africans as keenly aware of the economic inequality that beleaguers their society, and express a preference for greater distributive fairness. Broad support is also reported in relation to state-led redistribution, though a moderate declining trend is observed over the interval. Race and class differences characterise the survey results, though a majority of better-off South Africans (white, tertiary educated and non-poor citizens) still tend to be inequality averse and voice support for redistribution. Greater polarisation is evident with respect to inequality-related social policy, especially those designed to overcome historical racial disadvantage, though these intergroup differences converge considerably when referring to class-based policy measures. One surprising finding is the evidence that South Africa's youngest generation, known as the `Born Frees', tend to adopt a similar predisposition to redress policy as older generations, thus confounding expectations of a post-apartheid value change. Nonetheless, even though South Africans may not fully agree about the specific elements comprising a socially just response to the country's inequality problem, there does seem to be a stronger basis for a social compact for an inequality reduction agenda than is typically assumed.},

The authors ask to what extent resource-specific justice perceptions vary across two national groups of teachers (Jewish and Arab) in the Israeli population and educational system. Their findings indicate that Israeli teachers across sectors prefer differentiation (favoring equity over equality/need) and perceive more injustice when universalistic, rather than particularistic resources are at stake. At the same time, justice perceptions were found to vary across sectorial/cultural lines. For instance, Israeli-Arab teachers preferred differentiation of particularistic resources more strongly than their Israeli-Jewish counterparts. Sabbagh and Malka suggest that cross-cultural and cross-sectional research may provide a clearer understanding of patterns of convergence and divergence in the meanings assigned to social resources and of the corresponding distribution rules.},

Specifically, it investigates the extent to which Druze and Jewish students in Israel differ in their evaluations of the types of distribution rules that are actually and ideally preferred by teachers when they assign grades. Findings revealed that in both Jewish and Druze groups the achievement rules were ranked highest in terms of the actual and ideal ways of determining their grades. These were followed by the personality rules, and lastly by the ascriptive/particularistic rules. Thus, students in these groups share to a large extent their view about the actual and ideal grading practices. At the same time, Jewish students, who live in a market-driven society characterized by individual and competitive relations, ascribe stronger importance to meritocratic rules. In contrast, Druze students, who live in a highly homogeneous environment based on ascriptive status and solidarity relations, have a greater tendency than Jews to think that grading should be guided by particularistic/ascriptive types of rules. A structural analysis of grade distribution rule preferences revealed that they were similarly measured across groups.},

  abstract = {Faculty mentorship is a highly advantageous yet under-explored form of social capital which can grant access to co-curriculars (e.g., research assistantships), ensure strong letters of recommendation, and more. It is also typically informal and dependent on student initiative, requiring that students be skilled at engaging educational authority figures. Privileged students are most likely to have such skills as part of their dominant cultural capital, making faculty mentorship a site of social reproduction. To explore variations in this process, I compare two institution types: a small, teaching/undergraduate-focused regional university and a large, research-intensive flagship. In interviews with 68 working- and upper-middle-class students, I find that college context mediates the relationship of class background and faculty mentorship. Upper-middle-class students fostered advantageous faculty relationships at both universities, but working-class students diverged: at the flagship, they rarely approached professors in search of mentorship, while those at the regional university described close, beneficial connections with professors. I discuss working-class students' dissimilar experiences in terms of each university's structural and cultural characteristics (organizational habitus), particularly their institutional focus and size. I argue that through their particular organizational features, colleges can both reproduce and reduce inequalities, challenging the determinacy of precollege socialization in education.},

Our review shows that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by the evidence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing policies. Likewise, voter preferences for the redistribution of wealth depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures, and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair. Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic process is captured by the rich; however, the evidence explaining when, where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful avenue for future research.},

This book reveals how the political voices of organized interests are even less representative than those of individuals, how political advantage is handed down across generations, how recruitment to political activity perpetuates and exaggerates existing biases, how political voice on the Internet replicates these inequalities\textendash and more. In a true democracy, the preferences and needs of all citizens deserve equal consideration.

  abstract = {Political trust ???the trust that people place in political institutions- seems to be critical for democracy. However, there is no agreement as to what the origins of trust are. What makes citizens trust or distrust their main political institutions? How can we explain the differences found across and within countries? These are the main questions driving this dissertation. The central hypotheses of this study are (1) that we can found differences in levels of political trust both within and across countries, (2) that, at the individual level, political trust is related mainly to perceptions of fairness and competence of national governing institutions, and (3) that, at the country level, political trust is mostly explained by different levels of corruption. In order to evaluate these claims, I analyzed political trust data from the World Values Survey of 50 democracies of the industrialized world, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. To evaluate country differences I used these 50 democracies. To evaluate individual differences and the individual-level correlates of trust, I focused on seven Latin American countries. The results show that, at the country-level, political trust is higher among the most developed democracies and in those countries with longer democratic traditions, parliamentary governments and majoritarian electoral systems. These variables loose relevance and statistical power, however, when the country level of corruption is introduced. Corruption is, according to the results obtained, the major factor in explaining average levels of political trust. At the individual level data, in an analysis of Latin American citizens, we found that the most important factors explaining variations in political trust are those related to the perceptions of fairness and competence of their government institutions. Trust is considerably higher when institutions are considered fair and competent in their actions. Political trust is important for governments. And citizens decide when to grant trust to their political institutions as a response to a multiplicity of factors, of which the level of corruption and the perceptions of institutional fairness and competence are among the most important ones.}

Two waves of longitudinal survey data from 768 Czech high school students (T1 mean age 15.97) were analyzed using latent transition analysis. Results suggested three basic patterns of adolescents' views on democracy: majority-oriented (disregarding minority rights and interests), conventional (having narrowed understanding of civil liberties), and liberal (supporting both minority rights and civil liberties). Of these, the liberal view pattern was the least stable over time, and its stability was linked to adolescents' institutional trust and civic participation. Specifically, adolescents who were less trusting of institutions were more likely to adopt the majority-oriented (vs. liberal) view, while less civically active adolescents were more likely to switch to the conventional view. Authoritarianism was linked to adolescents' initial views, but it did not predict change over time. \textcopyright{} 2019},

Despite broad research in the context of adults' participation, the earlier formative years and the participation of students in school activities have been neglected so far. The present research examined antecedents and consequences of Latin American migrant students' participation in school activities in Chile. More specifically, we tested whether three forms of social recognition experiences (i.e., need-based care, equality-based respect and achievement-based social esteem) received from Chilean society predicted different forms of school participation. Heightened school participation was assumed to further translate into satisfaction with life. Results of a study with immigrant students (N = 393; 12-20 years old; 56.7\% female) revealed, that experiences of social esteem predicted an overall positive perception of school participation and this effect further translated into heightened life satisfaction. Moreover, experiences of respect were associated with participation in school decisions and rules and with participation in school events. The latter effect further translated into enhanced life satisfaction. Care did not play a role in predicting school participation when the other forms of recognition were controlled for. We discuss the importance of social recognition experiences and implications for interventions within educational systems.},

Using national survey data of Romanian eighth-grade and high school students, we evaluate this effect as a product of socioeconomic diversity within the classroom, controlling for the social status of the students as well as socioeconomic inequality within the community where the school is located. Our analysis shows that generalized trust is higher among older adolescents. However, despite this maturing effect, youth exposed to greater levels of socioeconomic diversity have significantly lower levels of trust. The effect is particularly acute for students in the ninth grade controlling for community diversity and polarization. The result reinforces the idea that generalized trust develops early in one's life and is quite stable, although a major life transformation, such as entering high school, may alter trust depending on the social context.},

Participatory budgeting (PB)-a set of democratic processes where residents determine how to spend a public budget-helps bridge that distance by letting the public make spending decisions. Since 2011, some of New York City's (NYC) council members have been implementing PB with their capital budget-setting aside a million dollars in their districts each budget cycle for PB. Participatory budgeting has the potential to rebuild relationships between government and communities. Using data from over eighty interviews conducted by New York University (NYU) graduate students in 2013 and 2014 with PBNYC participants over two years, this article suggests that in council districts using PB, residents have greater feelings of access to and voice in local government, and better understanding of the complexities of spending public monies, often leading to a more positive view of government officials, and bolstering legitimacy of local government.},

Among all available cultural ideas, which ones do parents select for transmission? As the recent normative approaches in cultural psychology highlight, cultural members do not just passively act out their internalized characteristics; they also strategically use their understanding of the culture's norms to guide their actions. This essay elaborates the implications of these approaches for understanding intergenerational cultural transmission. The perceived norms perspective is introduced. This perspective premises that when selecting cultural ideas for transmission, parents consider not only their own orientations but also their perceptions of what is normatively important in the culture. It further states that parents' reference to perceived norms is directed by the goals they hold. This essay discusses the contributions of this perspective to the study of intergenerational cultural transmission and identifies some directions for future research.},

Feelings of social exclusion, however, may be the result of psychological processes and in particular of (in)justice experiences. Based on just-world research, we hypothesized that (1) the more young people feel treated justly by parents, peers, and teachers and (2) the stronger their personal belief in a just world (BJW), the less they should feel socially excluded, and (3) their justice experiences mediate the effect of the personal BJW. In this article, we analyze the data from two late-adolescent samples to test these hypotheses (Study 1: N = 142 students from two academic-track secondary schools; Study 2: N = 154 students aiming for vocational or intermediate degrees). Hierarchical regression analyses consistently revealed that (a) psychological factors significantly explained feelings of social exclusion, whereas sociological factors did so only marginally, and (b) justice experiences significantly explained feelings of exclusion and (c) fully mediated the effect of the personal BJW. Results further suggest that the feelings of exclusion can be meaningfully categorized according to the context (e.g., society in general vs. school) and that context-related feelings of exclusion can be explained by different justice experiences.},

Findings from confirmatory factor analysis supported a four-factor instead of the original six-factor model.

The outcome consisted of AE cases diagnosed over the period 1980-1992. High vole density yielded a 10-fold risk (relative risk [RR] = 10.34, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.78-38.39), and the first plateau (400-700 m altitude) compared with the plain (200-400 m) was associated with a large increase in risk (RR = 7.10, 95\% CI = 1.30-38.63). These results confirm that human AE is strongly influenced by the densities of arvicolid species. Foxes feeding almost exclusively on grassland rodents when the latter expand could mediate this relation.},

I conducted a panel study and adopted a political socialization approach, proposing and verifying five hypotheses based on the theories of cognitive dissonance, assimilation, social contact, and social identity. The results indicate that compared with the average score for political trust that Chinese students exhibit at the time of arrival in Taiwan, the scores obtained four months later significantly declined by 0.09. Specifically, 50\% of students exhibited a decreased level of political trust, whereas 33\% exhibited an increased level of trust. The regression model developed in this study explains 23.6\% of the variance in the changes in the political trust of Chinese students studying in Taiwan. In addition, five hypotheses were empirically supported.},

  abstract = {Given the frequent critiques of elite universities for admitting low numbers of state school graduates and, more recently, British Afro-Caribbean students, how do students attending those universities make meaning of the admissions process? Through an analysis of 46 one-on-one in-depth interviews with undergraduates attending Oxford University, we show that students believe in the fairness of the admissions process, while lamenting the lack of opportunities for educational advancement faced by some disadvantaged youth in British society. Despite their understanding that many British youth do not have access to educational experiences that make Oxbridge an attainable goal, most students do not support changes to make access more equitable across class or racial/ethnic lines. This perspective, which legitimates the status students gain through matriculation at an elite university, supports the maintenance of unequal access to an Oxford education despite the advantages that education is known to confer to graduates. The findings demonstrate elites acknowledging the disadvantages of particular groups in society without acknowledging their own advantages in the same system. They do so by recognizing two elements of merit: (1) intelligence, which most students assumed led to their own admission; and (2) cultivation of that intelligence, which requires elite secondary schools and which most students see as disadvantaging particular groups in society. In the paper we highlight differences in meaning-making between graduates of grammar, comprehensive and private schools.},

We experimentally manipulated student race (Black vs. White) in a hypothetical scenario depicting physical police intervention stemming from a student's misbehavior. Teachers and administrators were significantly more punitive (i.e., requested juvenile detention and expulsion) toward the Black student than the White student. Moreover, endorsement of police legitimacy and legal authoritarianism (LA) predicted increased punitive attitudes toward the student, the belief that the student is dangerous, perceived likelihood that the student would recidivate, and perceived appropriateness of police officer behavior. Finally, the relationships between police legitimacy, LA, and perceived police behavior appropriateness were stronger when the student was portrayed as Black than White.},

Based on these theories, we hypothesized that students' perceptions of their teachers as autonomy supportive, mainly in the form of encouragement of critical thinking, and perhaps also choice, would be positively associated with students' advanced moral judgment. Data collected from 12th grade students in two regular schools and two democratic schools supported this hypothesis. Results also showed that being a student in a democratic school (as opposed to a regular one) was associated with autonomous moral judgment, and that this association was mediated by students' perceptions of teachers as encouraging criticism, but not choice. A possible implication is that programs of moral education should explicitly promote teachers' inclination to encourage critical thinking in their students.},

  abstract = {The belief that, in school, success only depends on will and hard work is widespread in Western societies despite evidence showing that several factors other than merit explain school success, including group belonging (e.g., social class, gender). In the present paper, we argue that because merit is the only track for low status students to reach upward mobility, Belief in School Meritocracy (BSM) is a particularly useful system-justifying tool to help them perceive their place in society as being deserved. Consequently, for low status students (but not high status students), this belief should be related to more general system-justifying beliefs (Study 1). Moreover, low status students should be particularly prone to endorsing this belief when their place within a system on which they strongly depend to acquire status is challenged (Study 2). In Study 1, high status (boys and high SES) were compared to low status (girls and low SES) high school students. Results indicated that BSM was related to system-justifying beliefs only for low SES students and for girls, but not for high SES students or for boys. In Study 2, university students were exposed (or not) to information about an important selection process that occurs at the university, depending on the condition. Their subjective status was assessed. Although such a confrontation reduced BSM for high subjective SES students, it tended to enhance it for low subjective SES students. Results are discussed in terms of system-justification motives and the palliative function meritocratic ideology may play for low status students.},

Loss of trust by spring of seventh grade predicted African Americans' subsequent discipline infractions and 4-year college enrollment. Causality was confirmed with a trust-restoring "wise feedback" treatment delivered in spring of seventh grade that improved African Americans' eighth-grade discipline and college outcomes. Correlational findings were replicated with Latino and White students (ages 11-14; Study 2, N = 206).},

The emphasis on luck in their narratives is categorised into three themes. The students linked their luckiness to deservedness, used luck as a way to express humbleness, and attributed their success to factors of chance. These themes are analysed against the backdrop of strong institutional support they receive as part of attending elite schools and being scholarship recipients. By being attentive to how luck is evoked in these narratives, we show that luck does not have an essential meaning and can produce different representations of legitimacy. The paper proposes the integration between critical and pragmatic sociological perspectives in order to advance our understandings of how elite groups qualify for the positions they obtain, how they define themselves and make sense of their educational merits.},

Confucian meritocracy is upheld as an equally viable alternative, if not a superior one, to democracy because many think that the latter's populist vices do not exist in the former's hierarchical, managerial political structure. This article addresses this seemingly dichotomous relationship between democracy and Confucian meritocracy by drawing on Zhu Xi (1130-1200 AD). I demonstrate those overlooked egalitarian qualities inherent in Confucian meritocracy, which can render itnaturally compatiblewith democracy. Thus, an accurate understanding of Confucian meritocracy requires us not to see it as an opposite of democracy. Rather, Confucian meritocracy actually fosters moral growth in the populace by encouraging them to participate in politics under the instruction of their political leaders, who are to be guided by two egalitarian pedagogical principles, that is, universal inclusion and student participation.},

A Monte Carlo simulation study illustrates that these procedures can underestimate or overestimate true mediation effects. Recommendations are provided for appropriately testing multilevel mediation and for differentiating within-group versus between-group effects in multilevel settings.},

  abstract = {Trust in Political Institutions (TIPI) is important for political stability as well as political change. We integrate two theories into the conceptualisation of political socialisations of students with and without immigration backgrounds: The theory of social capital conceptualises trust as a generalisation of positive social relationships, whereas the theory of the critical citizen implies that institutions need knowledgeable and scrutinising citizens for democratic improvements. This paper investigates the role of the school setting for political socialisation concerning TIPI using weighted German data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 (N = 1451 students in 59 classes; 52\% were girls; mean age was 14.29; 40\% of participants had immigration backgrounds). Students with immigration backgrounds reported relatively worse social relationships and bestowed less TIPI compared to their peers without immigration backgrounds. As predicted by the theory of social capital, all groups of students bestowed more TIPI if they experienced positive relationships at school to a higher degree. A weaker predictive power of civic knowledge on TIPI for students with immigration background supports notions of the critical citizen. Results indicate that social relationships are relevant for the formation of TIPI of all students, while the role of civic knowledge varies between social groups.},
