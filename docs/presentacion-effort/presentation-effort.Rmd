# Discussion

- Family socialisation: mixed, relevant only for the importance of hard work
- SES-family has an inconsistent association. SES at the school level positively influences the importance of hard work but is null for perceived rewards. 

- Justice experience in grades .bold[does not] have a direct influence on perceived meritocracy

- Interactions are mixed, decreasing the influence of socialisation on the importance of hard work, but positive effort is rewarded.
