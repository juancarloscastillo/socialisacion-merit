# Discussion

- Family socialisation: parents influence student's perceived meritocracy 

- SES-family has an inconsistent association. SES at the school does not influence student's perceived meritocracy in terms of the importance of hard work
- Justice experience in grades .bold[does not] have a direct influence on perceived meritocracy

- Negative justice experiences in grades descrease the influence of socialisation on the importance of hard work.
